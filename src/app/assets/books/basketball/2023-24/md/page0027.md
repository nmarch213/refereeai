## Substitutes and Player Eligibility

### Rule 3-3

#### ART. 2

The substitute shall remain outside the boundary until an official beckons, whereupon the substitute shall enter immediately. If the ball is about to become live, the beckoning signal should be withheld. The entering substitute shall not replace a designated jumper or a free thrower except as in [Rules 8-2](#rule-8-2) and [8-3](#rule-8-3). If the substitute enters to replace a player who shall jump or attempt a free throw, the substitute shall withdraw until the next opportunity to substitute.

#### ART. 3

A substitute becomes a player when the substitute legally enters the court. If entry is not legal, the substitute becomes a player when the ball becomes live. A player becomes bench personnel after the player's substitute becomes a player or after notification of the coach following the player's disqualification.

#### ART. 4

A player who has been replaced, or directed to leave the game shall not re-enter before the next opportunity to substitute after the clock has been started properly following the player's replacement.

#### ART. 5

A player not wearing the pants/skirt properly and above the hips and/or a player not tucking in a team jersey (front and back) designed to be worn inside the pants/skirt, shall be directed to leave the game as in [Rule 3-3-4](#rule-3-3-4); a charged time-out shall not alter this requirement.

#### ART. 6

A player who has been injured to the extent that the coach or any other bench personnel is beckoned and comes onto the court shall be directed to leave the game, unless a time-out is requested by, and granted to, the injured player's team and the situation can be corrected by the end of the time-out.

#### ART. 7

A player who is bleeding, has an open wound, has any amount of blood on the uniform, or has blood on the player's body shall be directed to leave the game until the bleeding is stopped, the wound is covered, the uniform and/or body is appropriately cleaned, and/or the uniform is changed before returning to competition, unless a time-out is requested by, and granted to, the player's team and the situation can be corrected by the end of the time-out. (See NFHS General Guidelines for Sports Hygiene, Skin Infections and Communicable Diseases in Appendix E on page 87.)

**NOTES:** (Arts. 6, 7)

1. If players from both teams are directed to leave the game because of injury/blood, both teams shall request and be granted a time-out in order to keep each player in the game, as in [Rule 5-11-8](#rule-5-11-8).
2. A time-out granted to keep a player in the game shall be requested before the replacement interval begins.

#### ART. 8

Any player who exhibits signs, symptoms or behaviors consistent with a concussion (such as loss of consciousness, headache, dizziness, confusion, or balance problems) shall be immediately removed from the game and shall not return to play until cleared by an appropriate health care professional. (See NFHS Suggested Guidelines for Management of Concussion in Sports in Appendix C on page 85.)
