> - b. The front of the guard's torso shall be facing the opponent.

#### ART. 3

> - a. The guard may have one or both feet on the playing court or be airborne, provided the guard has inbound status.
> - b. The guard is not required to continue facing the opponent.
> - c. The guard may move laterally or obliquely to maintain position, provided it is not toward the opponent when contact occurs.
> - d. The guard may raise hands or jump within the guard's own vertical plane.
> - e. The guard may turn or duck to absorb the shock of imminent contact.

#### ART. 4
> Guarding an opponent with the ball or a stationary opponent without the ball:
> - a. No time or distance is required to obtain an initial legal position.
> - b. If the opponent with the ball is airborne, the guard shall have obtained legal position before the opponent left the floor.

> Guarding a moving opponent without the ball:
> - a. Time and distance are factors required to obtain an initial legal position.
> - b. The guard shall give the opponent the time and/or distance to avoid contact.
