<!-- Section: Extra Period and Time-Outs -->

## Section 7: Extra Period

### Rule 5-7

If the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, play shall continue without change of baskets for one or more extra periods with a one-minute intermission before each extra period.

#### ART. 1

If the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, play shall continue without change of baskets for one or more extra periods with a one-minute intermission before each extra period.

#### ART. 2

The game ends if, at the end of any extra period, the score is not tied.

#### ART. 3

The length of each extra period shall be four minutes (or half the time of a regulation quarter for non-varsity contests). As many such periods as are necessary to break the tie shall be played. Extra periods are an extension of the fourth quarter.

#### ART. 4

Once the ball becomes live in the extra period, it will be played even though a correction in the fourth quarter score is made.

## Section 8: Time-Out, Stopping Play

A time-out occurs and the clock, if running, shall be stopped when an official:

### ART. 1

Signals:

- a. A foul.
- b. A held ball.
- c. A violation.
- d. A time-out.

### ART. 2

Stops play:

- a. Because of an injury as in [Rules 3-3-6](#rule-3-3-6), [3-3-7](#rule-3-3-7), and [3-3-8](#rule-3-3-8).
- b. To confer with the scorer or timer.
- c. Because of unusual delay in getting a dead ball live.
- d. For any other situations or any emergency.

> **NOTE:** When a player is injured as in Article 2(a), the official may suspend play after the ball is dead or is in control of the injured player's team or when the opponents complete a play. A play is completed when a team loses control (including throwing for goal) or withholds the ball from play by ceasing to attempt to score or advance the ball to a scoring position. When necessary to protect an injured player, the official may immediately stop play.

### ART. 3

Grants and signals a player's/head coach's oral or visual request for a time-out, such request being granted only when:

- a. The ball is at the disposal or in control of a player of the same team.
- b. The ball is dead, unless replacement of a disqualified, or injured player(s), or a player directed to leave the game is pending, and a substitute(s) is available and required.

### ART. 4

Responds to the scorer's signal to grant a coach's request that a correctable error, as in [Rule 2-10](#rule-2-10), or a timing, scoring or alternating-possession mistake be prevented or rectified. The appeal to the official shall be presented at the scorer's table where a coach of each team may be present.
