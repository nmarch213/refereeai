## Rule 7-3

### SECTION 3 CAUSING THE BALL TO GO OUT OF BOUNDS â€“ SIMULTANEOUSLY

#### ART. 1
If the ball goes out of bounds and was last touched simultaneously by two opponents, both of whom are inbounds or out of bounds, or if the official is in doubt as to who last touched the ball or if the officials disagree, play shall be resumed by the team entitled to the alternating-possession throw-in at the spot out of bounds nearest to where the simultaneous violation occurred.

#### ART. 2
If the alternating-possession procedure has not been established, play shall be resumed by a jump ball between the two players involved in the center restraining circle.

### SECTION 4 BALL AWARDED OUT OF BOUNDS
The ball is awarded out of bounds after:

#### ART. 1
A violation, as in [Rules 9-1 through 13](#rule-9-1).

#### ART. 2
A free throw for a technical foul, or a flagrant or intentional personal foul, as in [Rules 8-5-2 and 8-5-3](#rule-8-5-2).

#### ART. 3
A field goal or a successful free throw for any other personal foul as in [Rule 8-5-1](#rule-8-5-1) or an awarded goal, as in [Rules 9-11 and 9-12](#rule-9-11).

#### ART. 4
The ball becomes dead while a team is in control, provided no infraction or the end of a quarter/period is involved.

#### ART. 5
A player-control or team-control foul.

#### ART. 6
A common foul before the bonus rule is in effect.

#### ART. 7
A held ball, as in [Rule 4-25](#rule-4-25), after the alternating-possession procedure has been established.

### SECTION 5 RESUMPTION-OF-PLAY PROCEDURE, THROW-INS

#### ART. 1
When a team does not make a thrower available, after a time-out (as in [Rule 7-4-4](#rule-7-4-4)) or the intermission between any quarter (as in [Rule 6-2-3](#rule-6-2-3)), the resumption-of-play procedure is used to prevent delay. The administering official will sound the whistle to indicate play will resume. In each situation:
- The ball shall be put in play if Team A is ready or it shall be placed on the floor.
- The throw-in count shall begin and if a violation occurs, the procedure will be repeated for Team B.
- Following a violation by one team only, if that team continues to delay when authorized to make a throw-in, it is a technical foul.
- Following a violation by both teams, any further delay by either team is a technical foul.

#### ART. 2
After an out-of-bounds violation in either the frontcourt or the backcourt by either team as in [Rule 9-3](#rule-9-3), the throw-in shall be at the designated spot nearest to where the ball went out of bounds.
