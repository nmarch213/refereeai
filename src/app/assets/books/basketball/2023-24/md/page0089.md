## General Guidelines for Sports Hygiene, Skin Infections and Communicable Diseases

Proper precautions are needed to minimize the potential risk of the spread of communicable disease and skin infections during athletic competition. These conditions include skin infections that occur due to skin contact with competitors and equipment. The transmission of infections such as **Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** and **Herpes Gladiatorum**, blood-borne pathogens such as **HIV** and **Hepatitis B**, and other infectious diseases such as **Influenza** and **COVID-19** can often be greatly reduced through proper hygiene. The NFHS SMAC has outlined and listed below some general guidelines for the prevention of the spread of these diseases.

### Universal Hygiene Protocol for All Sports: Blood-Borne Infectious Diseases

Strategies for reducing the potential exposure to these agents include following Universal Precautions such as:

- **Shower immediately after every competition and practice**, using liquid soap and not a shared bar soap.
- **Wash all workout clothing after each practice**, washing in hot water and drying on a high heat setting.
- **Clean and/or wash all personal gear** (knee pads, head gear, braces, etc.) and gym bags at least weekly.
- **Do not share towels or personal hygiene products** (razors) with others.
- **Refrain from full body and/or cosmetic shaving** of head, chest, arms, legs, abdomen, and groin.
- **Students should clean hands** with an alcohol-based gel or soap and water before and after every practice and contest to decrease bacterial load on the hands.
- **Covering up coughs and sneezes** in the bend of the elbow instead of the hand.
- **Stay home from school and athletic participation** if frequent cough, diarrhea, vomiting, or fever occurs.

In the event of a blood or body fluid-splash, immediately wash contaminated skin or mucous membranes with soap and water. Skin antiseptics (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) or moist towelettes may be used if soap and water are not available. Clean all contaminated surfaces and equipment with disinfectant before returning to competition. Be sure to use gloves when cleaning.

### Infectious Skin Diseases

Strategies for reducing the potential exposure to these infectious agents include:

- **Students must notify a parent/guardian and coach** of any skin lesion prior to any competition or practice. An appropriate health-care professional must evaluate all concerning skin lesions before returning to practices or competition.
- **If an outbreak occurs on a team**, especially in a contact sport, all team members should be evaluated to help prevent the potential spread of the infection. All shared equipment shall be properly cleaned/disinfected prior to use.
- **Blood on an opponent’s uniform during competition** or teammate’s uniform during practice should be cleaned at that time by wiping with a disinfectant such as isopropyl alcohol.
- **Any blood exposure or bites to the skin** that break the surface must be reported and immediately evaluated by an appropriate health-care professional.

### Other Communicable Diseases

Means of reducing the potential exposure to these agents include:

- **Make certain that students, coaching staff, and medical staff are current on all required vaccinations** (MMR, Hepatitis B, Chickenpox, Meningitis, Hepatitis A). COVID-19 vaccine participation with a covered yearly influenza vaccine are strongly encouraged.
- **During times of outbreaks**, follow the guidelines set forth by the CDC as well as State and local Health Departments.
