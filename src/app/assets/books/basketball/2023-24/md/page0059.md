### SECTION 1 FREE-THROW ADMINISTRATION

> **ART. 1** When a free throw is awarded, the ball shall be placed at the disposal of the free thrower (bounced) by the administering official and the free throw count shall begin. Either or both teams may be charged with a violation.

> **ART. 2** Following a time-out or intermission, the resumption-of-play procedure may be used to prevent delay. The administering official shall sound the whistle to indicate play will resume. The ball shall be placed at the disposal of the thrower or placed on the floor at the free-throw line and the count shall begin. Either or both teams may be charged with a violation. Following a violation by one or both teams, if the offending team(s) continues to delay, a team technical foul shall be ruled.

> **ART. 3** If the ball is to become dead when the last free throw for a specific penalty is not successful, players shall not occupy any spaces along the free-throw lane lines.

> **ART. 4** During a free throw, lane spaces may be occupied as follows:
> - a. Marked lane spaces may be occupied by a maximum of two offensive players; four defensive players may occupy lane spaces.
> - b. The first marked lane spaces on each side of the lane, above and adjacent to the first lane-space marks, shall be occupied by opponents of the free thrower. No teammate of the free thrower shall occupy either of these marked lane spaces.
> - c. The second marked lane spaces on each side may be occupied by teammates of the free thrower.
> - d. The third marked lane spaces on each side, nearest the free thrower, may be occupied by the opponents of the free thrower.
> - e. Players shall be permitted to move along and across the lane to occupy a vacant marked lane space within the limitations listed in this rule.
> - f. Not more than one player may occupy any part of a marked lane space.
