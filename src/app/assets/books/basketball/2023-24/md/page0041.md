<!-- Section: Held Ball -->
## SECTION 25 HELD BALL

A held ball occurs when:

### ART. 1
Opponents have their hands so firmly on the ball that control cannot be obtained without undue roughness.

### ART. 2
An opponent places a hand(s) on the ball and prevents an airborne player from throwing the ball or releasing it on a try or tap for field goal.

<!-- Section: Holding -->
## SECTION 26 HOLDING

Holding is illegal personal contact with an opponent which interferes with the opponent's freedom of movement.

<!-- Section: Incidental Contact -->
## SECTION 27 INCIDENTAL CONTACT

Incidental contact is contact with an opponent which is permitted and which does not constitute a foul.

### ART. 1
The mere fact that contact occurs does not constitute a foul. When 10 players are moving rapidly in a limited area, some contact is certain to occur.

### ART. 2
Contact, which may result when opponents are in equally favorable positions to perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal, even though the contact may be severe.

### ART. 3
Contact, which does not hinder the opponent from participating in normal defensive or offensive movements, should be considered incidental.

### ART. 4
A player who is screened within the player's visual field is expected to avoid contact with the screener by stopping or going around the screener. In cases of screens outside the visual field, the opponent may make inadvertent contact with the screener, and such contact is to be ruled incidental contact, provided the screener is not displaced if the screener has the ball.

### ART. 5
If a player approaches an opponent from behind or from a position from which the player has no reasonable chance to play the ball without making contact with the opponent, the responsibility is on the player in the unfavorable position.

<!-- Section: Jump Ball -->
## SECTION 28 JUMP BALL

### ART. 1
A jump ball is a method of putting the ball into play to start the game and each extra period by tossing it up between two opponents in the center restraining circle, or as in [Rule 7-3](#rule-7-3) before the alternating-possession procedure has been established.

### ART. 2
The jump ball begins when the ball leaves the official's hand(s) and ends when the touched ball contacts a nonjumper, an official or the floor.

<!-- Section: Kicking the Ball -->
## SECTION 29 KICKING THE BALL

Kicking the ball is intentionally striking it with any part of the leg or foot.
