## Rule 1-6

### SECTION 6: FREE-THROW LINE

**ART. 3**  
The free-throw lane line and semicircle shall be the same color as the three-point line. See Table 1, No. 3 if the use of contrasting colored-floor areas instead of the lines is desirable.

A free-throw line, 2 inches wide, shall be drawn across both semicircles, which have an outside radius of 6 feet as shown in ![Diagram 1](link-to-diagram-1). It shall be parallel to the end line and shall have its farthest edge 15 feet from the plane of the face of the backboard.

### SECTION 7: BACKBOARDS

**ART. 1**  
The backboards shall be the same size at both ends of the court. The backboard shall be one of three types:

1. a rectangle 6 feet horizontally and 4 feet vertically;
2. a rectangle 6 feet horizontally and 3½ feet vertically;
3. a fan-shaped backboard, 54 inches wide and with dimensions as shown in ![Diagram 2](link-to-diagram-2).

_NOTE:_ The 6-foot horizontal and 3½-foot vertical dimensions are recommended for replacement backboards or new installations.

**ART. 2**  
Each of the backboards shall be of any rigid material. The front surface shall be flat and, unless it is transparent, it shall be white. Tinted glass backboards are prohibited. ![Diagram 2](link-to-diagram-2) gives specifications for the three types of backboards. See [Rule 1](#rule-1), [Sections 7](#section-7), [8](#section-8), [9](#section-9). It is not legal to paint a fan-shaped board on a rectangular backboard.

_NOTE:_ For the fan-shaped backboard in transparent material, the recurved cut-out at the bottom may be filled in and the ring attached to the front of the backboard.

**ART. 3**  
If the backboard is transparent, it shall be marked as follows: A rectangle shall be centered behind the ring and marked by a 2-inch white line. The rectangle shall have outside dimensions of 24 inches horizontally and 18 inches vertically. For the rectangular backboard, the top edge of the backboard shall be level with the ring. For the fan-shaped backboard, the baseline shall be omitted, and the two vertical lines shall be extended to the bottom of the backboard. The rectangular target in a bright orange or black color may be used on a nontransparent backboard. The border of the backboard shall be marked with a white line. The border shall be 3 inches or less in width.
