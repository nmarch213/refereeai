## Rule 7-5

### ART. 3

After a violation ([Rule 9-4 through 9-13](#rule-9-4)) by either team, a foul by either team before the bonus is in effect, or any other stoppage in play, the throw-in location will be determined by the location of the violation/foul or the location of the ball when the stoppage occurs:

- If the throw-in is to be in the team's frontcourt, it shall be at either the nearest 28-foot mark along each sideline or the nearest spot 3-feet outside the lane line along the end line. (Diagram 5)
- If the throw-in is to be in the team's backcourt, the throw-in shall be at the designated spot nearest to where the foul, violation, or other stoppage in play occurred.

### ART. 4

Officials shall determine the designated spot by using an imaginary line drawn from the intersection of the end line with the sideline to each lane line where it intersects with the free-throw line including the semicircle. If the stoppage of play occurs inside the imaginary line, the designated spot shall be the nearest point on the end line 3-feet outside the lane line. (See Number 1 on Diagram 5.) If the stoppage occurs outside the imaginary line, the designated spot shall be the nearest sideline at the 28-foot line. (See Number 2 on Diagram 5.)
