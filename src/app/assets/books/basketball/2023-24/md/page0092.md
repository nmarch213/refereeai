## Modifications for Competition Below Ninth Grade

Interscholastic competition at the middle school/junior high level can make valuable contributions to educational programming, provided the sport is properly organized, supervised, and regulated. Students in this particular age group have unique physical, psychological, emotional, and developmental needs. In order to minimize the risk of injury, it may be necessary to modify regulations to offer meaningful competition for different groups. These recommended modifications are for middle school/junior high competition. State associations may adopt additional modifications and/or use other rules codes for middle school/junior high competition.

### Size of the Court
The field of play shall be rectangular and is recommended to be no larger than 84 by 50 feet for middle level/junior high school competition.

### Ball Size
Either the 29½ or 28½ inch ball may be legally used for boys’ middle school competition.

### Length of Periods of Play
Games involving only students below the ninth grade shall be played in six-minute quarters with intermissions of one minute after the first and third quarters, and 10 minutes between halves. Playing time and number of quarters for non-varsity game quarters may be reduced by mutual agreement of opposing coaches.
