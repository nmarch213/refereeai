### PENALTIES: (Section 1) {#subsection-free-throws-penalties}
1. If the first or only violation is by the free thrower or a teammate, the ball becomes dead when the violation occurs, and no point can be scored by that throw. The following out-of-bounds provisions apply if no further free throws are to be administered:
   - a. If the violation occurs during a free throw for a personal foul, other than intentional or flagrant, the ball is awarded to the opponents for a throw-in from the designated out-of-bounds spot nearest the violation.
   - b. If the violation occurs during a free throw for a technical foul, the ball is awarded to the thrower's team for a throw-in at the division line on the side of the court opposite the scorer's and timer's table.
   - c. If the violation occurs during a free throw for a flagrant personal foul or an intentional personal foul, the ball is awarded to the thrower's team for a throw-in from the designated out-of-bounds spot nearest the foul.
2. If the violation is by the free-thrower's opponent only:
   - a. If the try is successful, the goal counts and the violation is disregarded.
   - b. If the try is not successful, the ball becomes dead when the free throw ends, and a substitute throw shall be attempted by the same free thrower under the same conditions as for the free throw for which it is substituted.
