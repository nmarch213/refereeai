Rule 4-7 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 32 ART. 2 . . . Touches the ball while any part of the ball is within the imaginary cylinder which has the basket ring as its lower base. EXCEPTION: In Arts. 1 or 2, if a player has a hand legally in contact with the ball, it is not a violation if such contact with the ball continues after it enters the imaginary cylinder or if in such action, the player touches the basket. Dunking or stuffing is legal and is not basket interference. ART. 3 . . . Touches the ball outside the cylinder while reaching through the basket from below. ART. 4 . . . Pulls down a movable ring so that it contacts the ball before the ring returns to its original position. SECTION 7 BLOCKING, CHARGING ART. 1 . . . Blocking is illegal personal contact which impedes the progress of an opponent with or without the ball. ART. 2 . . . Charging is illegal personal contact caused by pushing or moving into an opponent's torso. a. A player who is moving with the ball is required to stop or change direction to avoid contact if a defensive player has obtained a legal guarding position in the player's path. b. If a guard has obtained a legal guarding position, the player with the ball shall get head and shoulders past the torso of the defensive player. If contact occurs on the torso of the defensive player, the dribbler is responsible for the contact. c. There shall be reasonable space between two defensive players or a defen- sive player and a boundary line to allow the dribbler to continue in the drib- ber's path. If there is less than 3 feet of space, the dribbler has the greater responsibility for the contact. d. The player with the ball may not push the torso of the guard to gain an advantage to pass, shoot or dribble. SECTION 8 BONUS FREE THROWS ART. 1 . . . The bonus is the two free throws awarded for a common foul (ex- cept a player-control or team-control foul) as follows: a. Beginning with a team's fifth foul in each quarter, two free throws are awarded, regardless of whether or not the first free throw is successful. b. Team fouls will be reset to zero at the end of each quarter. NOTE: Rule 2-10-1a, b is applied if a merited free throw is not awarded or an unmerited free throw is awarded. ART. 2 . . . Player-control, team-control and technical fouls are counted as team fouls to reach the bonus. When a technical foul is also charged indirectly to the head coach, it counts only as one team foul. SECTION 9 BOUNDARY LINES ART. 1 . . . Boundary lines of the court consist of end lines and sidelines. ART. 2 . . . The inside edges of these lines define the inbounds and out-of- bounds areas.
