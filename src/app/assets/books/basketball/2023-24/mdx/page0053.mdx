Page 51 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules SECTION 3 JUMP-BALL ADMINISTRATION ART. 1 . . . For any jump ball, each jumper shall have both feet within that half of the center restraining circle which is farther from the jumper's basket. ART. 2 . . . When the official is ready and until the ball is tossed, nonjumpers shall not: a. Move onto the center restraining circle. b. Change position around the center restraining circle. ART. 3 . . . Teammates may not occupy adjacent positions around the center restraining circle if an opponent indicates a desire for one of these positions be- fore the official is ready to toss the ball. ART. 4 . . . The ball shall be tossed upward between the jumpers in a plane at right angles to the sidelines. The toss shall be to a height greater than either of them can jump so that it will drop between them. ART. 5 . . . Until the tossed ball is touched by one or both jumpers, nonjumpers shall not: a. Have either foot break the plane of the center restraining circle cylinder. b. Take a position in any occupied space. ART. 6 . . . The tossed ball shall be touched by one or both of the jumpers after it reaches its highest point. If the ball contacts the floor without being touched by at least one of the jumpers, the official shall toss it again. ART. 7 . . . Neither jumper shall: a. Touch the tossed ball before it reaches its highest point. b. Leave the center restraining circle until the ball has been touched. c. Catch the ball before the jump ball ends. d. Touch the ball more than twice. ART. 8 . . . The jump ball and the restrictions in Rule 6-3-7 end when the touched ball contacts one of the eight nonjumpers, an official or the floor. NOTE: During a jump ball, a jumper is not required to face the jumper's own basket, provided the jumper is in the proper half of the center restraining circle. The jumper is also not required to jump and attempt to touch the tossed ball. However, if neither jumper touches the ball it should be tossed again with both jumpers being ordered to jump and try to touch the ball. SECTION 4 ALTERNATING POSSESSION ART. 1 . . . Other than the start of the game and each extra period, the teams will alternate taking the ball out of bounds for a throw-in. The team obtaining control from the jump ball establishes the alternating-possession procedure, and the arrow is set toward the opponent's basket. Control may also be established by the results of a violation or foul, as in Rule 4-3. ART. 2 . . . To start the second, third and fourth quarters, the throw-in shall be from out of bounds at the division line opposite the scorer's and timer's table. Rule 6-3
