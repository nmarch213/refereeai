Appendix A 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 82 APPENDIX A DUTIES OF GAME MANAGEMENT I. Relationship of Game Management to Officials: A. General: Most individuals officiate because it is an avocation that provides the opportunity to main- tain contact with the game and with those who administer the contests. If responsible and highly respected people are to be kept in the field, they should be accorded the cordial and businesslike treatment they expect in professions and other vocations. They are requested to render decisions in rather technical matters and in an atmosphere charged with prejudice and emotion. No effort should be spared in providing conditions that will be conducive to efficiency and pleasant associ- ations. Each contest administrator owes this to the official who is a guest and to the school that must depend on the work being of such a nature as to attract people who are in the habit of being treated with respect. B. Reminders: 1. Notify the officials at least one week before each game giving the exact time and place of the game and the location of the officials' dressing room. 2. Inform each official who they will be working with. Perhaps a ride can be shared. 3. Secure the visiting-school's approval of the officials, if appropriate, several weeks before the game and confirm the approval as soon as possible. 4. If parking facilities are a problem, provide a place for the officials. 5. Designate an official's host. The host should meet them at the door, escort them to the dress- ing room(s) and see that they are provided with towels and soap. The host may also accompa- ny the officials to the floor and take care of their jackets and be responsible for the game ball between halves. The host management should provide personnel to wipe moisture from the floor, clean up blood and maintain proper floor conditions as requested by the officials. 6. Provide a clean, private dressing room with shower or nearby shower stall. Before and after a game, and at halftime, the officials room(s) should be "out of bounds" for everyone except the few who have a definite assignment in this area. Insist that coaches instruct their players to be courteous and respectful to all officials. A time- out should be requested if questions are to be directed to the officials, and the privilege of asking questions should be delegated to the captain only. Questions should be limited to those dealing with rules interpretation or game procedure. Nothing is ever gained by questioning an official's judgment, and it may lead to a penalty. A public expression of dissent from an official's judgment decision merely excites the fans and often results in a penalty. 8. Keep your crowd under control. A continuing program of education and training will work wonders. Police protection should be available and in evidence. 9. Do not permit any type of artificial noisemakers. Bands and other music may only be played during pregame, time-outs, intermission and post-game. 10. Insist that coaches set good examples for your crowd and players. Properly use the optional coaching box. Do not shout at players or officials. The coach, more than any other person, sets the pattern for the attitude of the fans. 11. Do not permit coaches to argue or visit with the official during a game or during an inter- mission. Criticizing an official in front of fans or players invites trouble. Avoid the officials' dressing room(s) unless, just before their departure, you wish to visit briefly. If you have a grievance, stay away. Communicate with officials after two or three days have passed and emotions have settled. 12. You either hired or approved the officials. Take your share of the blame if you are not pleased. The chances are about 100 to 1 â€“ or less that your team lost the game because of the officiating. 13. Emotions need to be controlled. Basketball calls for coaches and players who have poise and coolness under fire. Team directors must demonstrate the same qualities. 7.
