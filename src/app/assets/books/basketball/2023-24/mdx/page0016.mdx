Rule 1-10 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 14 ART. 2 . . . Any backboard support behind the backboard and at a height of less than 9 feet above the floor shall be padded on the bottom surface to a distance of 2 feet from the face of the backboard. All portable backstops shall have the bases padded to a height of 7 feet on the court-side surface. ART. 3 . . . Clearances – As below and behind backboards, all support systems should be at least 8 feet behind the plane of the backboard face and at a height of 7 feet or more above the floor. ART. 4 . . . Any backboard support, all of which is not directly behind the back- board, should be at least 6 inches behind it if the support extends above the top and at least 2 feet behind it if the support extends beyond the side. Any overhead backboard support structure which shall be forward-braced due to space limita- tions, architectural or structural restraints, shall meet the following requirements: A front, diagonal-brace system shall be located above a line extending upward and into the playing court at a maximum 45-degree angle from a point on a vertical line located a minimum of 6 inches behind the front side of the backboard at a minimum height of 4 feet 6 inches above the basket ring. ART. 5 . . . Warning on misuse of portable backstops – Manufacturers and administrators should be aware of an "extreme-caution" warning relative to the misuse of portable backstops. A high degree of injury potential and a severe lia- bility problem exists when players or spectators are allowed to hang, sit or stand on the basket ring or backboard. Administrators shall see that this practice is eliminated or that the portable units are lowered at the completion of the game.

The ring and its attaching flange and braces shall be bright orange in color. ART. 3 . . . The cord of the net shall be not less than 120-thread nor more than 144-thread twine, or plastic material of comparable dimensions with no additional extensions. It shall be constructed to momentarily check the ball as it passes through. SECTION 11 BASKET RING ART. 1 . . .
