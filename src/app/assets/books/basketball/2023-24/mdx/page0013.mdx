Page 11 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 1-3 ART. 2 . . . If, on an unofficial court, there is less than 3 feet of unobstructed space outside any sideline or end line, a narrow broken line shall be marked on the court parallel with and 3 feet inside that boundary. This restraining line becomes the boundary line during a throw-in on that side or end, as in Rule 7-6. It contin- ues to be the boundary until the ball crosses the line. SECTION 3 CENTER RESTRAINING CIRCLE, DIVISION LINE ART. 1 . . . A restraining circle shall be drawn at the center of the court with a radius of 6 feet measured to the outside edge. The edge of the circle shall be des- ignated with a minimum of a ¼-inch-wide single line but no wider than 2 inches. See Table 1, No. 3 if the use of contrasting colored-floor areas instead of a line is desirable. Spaces for nonjumpers around the center circle are 36 inches deep. ART. 2 . . . A division line 2 inches wide, shall divide the court into two equal parts. If the court is less than 74 feet long, it should be divided by two lines, each parallel to and 40 feet from the farther end line. ART. 3 . . . Shadow-bordered lines are permissible. A shadow line is a line that designates the required width by use of border or outline lines at least ¼-inch wide, which shall lie within the required width. Border lines that are the natural color of the court are permissible. The area within these lines need not be one col- or, but the continuous outline shall be clearly visible to the officials. If the floor has a logo in the center of the court, that logo should not distract from the visibility of the division line or center circle. SECTION 4 THREE-POINT LINE ART. 1 . . . A three-point line, 2 inches wide in the form of a semicircle, shall be drawn at each end of the court as shown in Diagram 1. The semicircle has a radius of 19 feet 9 inches from a point in the middle of the free-throw lane directly below the center of the basket to the outside edge of the line. The semicircle shall be extended with a 2-inch wide line perpendicular to the end line, the length of which shall be 63 inches from the inside edge of the end line. ART. 2 . . . The three-point line shall be the same color as the free-throw lane boundary lines and free-throw semicircle. SECTION 5 FREE-THROW LANE ART. 1 . . . A free-throw lane, 12 feet wide measured to the outside of each lane boundary, and the semicircle with the free-throw line as a diameter, shall be marked at each end of the court with dimensions and markings as shown in Diagram 1. All lines designating the free-throw lane, but not lane-space marks are part of the lane. ART. 2 . . . The lane-space marks (2 inches by 8 inches) identify areas which extend 36 inches from the outer edge of the lane lines toward the sidelines. There are three lane spaces on each lane boundary line.
