When an obvious mistake by the shot clock operator has occurred (failing to start, stop, set or reset the shot clock) or when a shot clock has malfunctioned, the mistake or the result of the malfunction may be corrected during the shot clock period in which it occurred and only when the official has definite informa- tion relative to the mistake or malfunction and the time involved. 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules SHOT CLOCK VIOLATION 1. A shot clock period begins when the ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court on a throw-in or when team control is established or re-es- tablished after loss of team control and the shot clock is properly started. The shot clock period ends when the shot clock is properly started for the next shot clock period. 2. A try for goal during the shot clock period is defined as the ball having left the shooter’s hand(s) before the sounding of the shot clock horn and then striking the ring or flange, or entering the basket. 3. The team in control must attempt a try for a field goal within the 35-second shot clock period. 4. It is a violation when a try for field goal does not leave the shooter’s hand(s) before the expiration of the shot clock period (as indicated by the sounding of the shot clock horn) or when it does leave the shooter’s hand(s) before the expiration of the shot clock period and the try does not subsequently strike the ring or flange or enter the basket.
