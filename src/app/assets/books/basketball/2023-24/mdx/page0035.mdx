The distance shall be measured from the forward foot/feet of the defender to the forward foot/feet of the ball handler.

A closely guarded count shall be terminated when the offensive player in control of the ball gets head and shoulders past the defensive player.

SECTION 11 CONTINUOUS MOTION ART.

1 .

.

.

Continuous motion applies to a try or tap for field goals and free throws, but it has no significance unless there is a foul by any defensive player during the interval which begins when the habitual throwing movement starts a try or with the touching on a tap and ends when the ball is clearly in flight.

ART.

2 .

.

.

If an opponent fouls after a player has started a try or tap for field goal, the player is permitted to complete the customary arm movement, and if pivoting or stepping when fouled, may complete the usual foot or body movement in any activity while holding the ball.

These privileges are granted only when the usual throwing motion has started before the foul occurs and before the ball is in flight.

ART.

3 .

.

.

Continuous motion does not apply if a teammate fouls after a player has started a try or tap for field goal and before the ball is in flight.

The ball be- comes dead immediately.
