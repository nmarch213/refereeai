National Federation of State High School Associations OFFICIALS CODE OF ETHICS Officials at an interscholastic athletic event are participants in the educational development of high school students. As such, they must exercise a high level of self-discipline, independence and responsibility. The purpose of this Code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all interscholastic officials. • Officials shall master both the rules of the game and the mechanics necessary to enforce the rules, and shall exercise authority in an impartial, firm and controlled manner. • Officials shall work with each other and their state associations in a constructive and cooperative manner. • Officials shall uphold the honor and dignity of the profession in all interaction with student-athletes, coaches, athletic directors, school administrators, colleagues, and the public. This includes, but is not limited to, positive verbal and nonverbal communication with coaches, bench personnel and players. • Officials shall avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco products beginning with the arrival at the competition site until departure following the completion of the contest. • Officials shall prepare themselves both physically and mentally, shall dress neatly and appropriately, and shall comport themselves in a manner consistent with the high standards of the profession. • Officials shall be punctual and professional in the fulfillment of all contractual obligations. • Officials shall remain mindful that their conduct influences the respect that student-athletes, coaches and the public hold for the profession. • Officials shall, while enforcing the rules of play, remain aware of the inherent risk of injury that competition poses to student-athletes. Where appropriate, officials shall inform event manage- ment of conditions or situations that appear unreasonably hazardous. • Officials shall take reasonable steps to educate themselves in the recognition of emergency conditions that might arise during the course of competition. • Officials shall maintain an ethical approach while participating in forums, chat rooms and all forms of social media.
