2023-24 Points of Emphasis Uniforms, Equipment and Apparel The NFHS regularly receives questions regarding the legality of uniforms, equipment and apparel. It is imperative that not only officials understand the rules governing uniforms and equipment, but coaches and players as well. Uniform jerseys must comply with the rules listed in 3-4, 3-5 and 3-6. The rules are concise and clear regarding what is and is not permissible on the jersey. An NFHS basketball uniform guide was created to illustrate the proper uniform design graphically. That document and an animated presentation can be found on the NFHS website. Uniforms A. Requests to make an exception to Rule 3-4, Uniforms (e.g., Pink Out night, Retro/ Throw Back night, Military Appreciation night) must be submitted to the state asso- ciation before the event for approval. Uniform requirements MAY NOT be altered by mutual agreement between schools or coaches. B. As has been the rule in the past, uniform bottoms do not have to match the torso of the uniform; however, with the adoption of Rule 3-4-5, uniform bottoms must be like-col- ored among teammates. To provide clarity, the following examples are provided: • Teammates may wear multiple styles of uniform bottoms, which may include shorts, skirts or pants. • The color of the uniform bottoms are not required to be the same as the uniform top; however, the bottoms must be a consistent color among teammates. The bot- tom style may differ for every player, but the color must be the same. Example – A1 is wearing a white jersey and red shorts. A2 is wearing a white jersey and a red skirt. Legal, as long as the bottom is red for all five players. C. Rolling and/or tucking of uniform bottoms is permissible, as long as the compression tights/sleeves, if worn, are color compliant. Equipment and Apparel A. Undershirts, if worn, must adhere to the following: • Home Team – Shall be white, shall be hemmed, and shall not have frayed or ragged edges. If the undershirt has sleeves, they shall be the same length. • Visiting Team – Shall be a single solid color similar to the torso of the jersey OR be solid black. The undershirt shall be hemmed and shall not have frayed or ragged edges. If the undershirt has sleeves, they shall be the same length. Team members may wear either a single solid color similar to the torso of the jersey or black, but not both. Example – Visitor B1 wears a purple jersey and a black undershirt. Visitor B2 is wearing a purple jersey and purple undershirt. Illegal. Both undershirts are a legal color; how- ever, teammates must wear the same color undershirt. This situation would be legal if all teammates wore a black undershirt or if all teammates wore a purple undershirt. B. Arm sleeves, knee sleeves, lower leg sleeves, compression shorts and tights are per- missible: • Anything worn on the arm and/or leg is a sleeve, except a knee brace, and shall meet the color restrictions. • The sleeves/tights and compression shorts shall be black, white, beige or the predomi- nant color of the jersey, and the same color sleeves/tights shall be worn by teammates. • All sleeves/tights and compression shorts shall be the same solid color and shall be the same solid color as any headband or wristband worn. Coaches and school administrators must ensure that legal uniforms are being ordered and purchased from manufacturers/distributors. If in doubt, PRIOR to purchasing uniforms, equipment or apparel, confirm legality with the local state association.
