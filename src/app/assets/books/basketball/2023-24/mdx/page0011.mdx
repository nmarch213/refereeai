Table 1 Supplement to Basketball Court Court Specifications: 1. If possible, building plans should provide for a court with ideal measurements as stated in Rule 1-1, ample out-of-bounds area and necessary seating space. A long court permits use of two crosswise courts for practice and informal games. 2. It is recommended that the area above the court be clear of any obstructions and be at least 25 feet or higher. 3. Instead of the 2-inch minimum boundaries, it is legal to use contrasting-col- ored floor areas by painting the out-of-bounds area, the center restraining circle, and the restricted parts of the free-throw lanes so that the mathemat- ical line between the two colors is the boundary. If such contrasting colored out-of-bounds belt is used, it should be at least 8 inches wide. 4. It is recommended that a belt 8 inches wide or more in width be used to mark the boundaries on all courts which have at least 10 feet of open space between the boundary lines and the seating. This plan is urged for all new construction and for other similar courts when the boundaries are remarked. 5. It is recommended that there be a 2-inch wide broken line consisting of 12- inch segments, 12 inches apart, of a color different from that of the boundary, at a minimum of 6 feet outside the court extending from sideline to sideline and parallel to the end line. 6. Coaching box â€“ tableside. Bounded by a line drawn 28 feet from the end line towards the division line. A line, perpendicular to the 28-foot line and placed at each end, with a minimum length of 2 feet, shall be extended toward the team bench so that the coaching box boundary is evident. The same direc- tions should be followed for the other side of the scorer's table. NOTE: State associations may, on an individual basis, alter the length and allow alter- native bench locations. 7. The court should be uniformly and adequately lighted. Lighting engineers should be placed in charge of this important factor when planning any new in- stallations. For information on recommended specifications for lighting, you may contact: Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, 120 Wall St., 17th Floor, New York, NY 10005, 212-248-5000. FACILITIES Because facilities used for high school athletics come in many shapes, sizes and conditions, on-site event management may on occasion conclude that compliance with NFHS directives about event configuration is not feasible. Under all circumstances, on- site event management should utilize set-ups that minimize risk. If a given facility can- not be made reasonably hazard-free, the event should be relocated.
