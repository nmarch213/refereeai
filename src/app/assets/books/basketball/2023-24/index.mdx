2023-24 NFHS BASKETBALL RULES BOOK Dr. KARISSA L. NIEHOFF, Publisher Lindsey Atkinson, Editor NFHS Publications To maintain the sound traditions of this sport, encourage sportsmanship and mini- mize the inherent risk of injury, the National Federation of State High School Associa- tions (NFHS) writes playing rules for varsity competition among student-athletes of high school age. High school coaches, officials and administrators who have knowledge and experience regarding this particular sport and age group volunteer their time to serve on the rules committee. Member associations of the NFHS independently make decisions regarding compliance with or modification of these playing rules for the student-athletes in their respective states. NFHS rules are used by education-based and non-education-based organizations serving children of varying skill levels who are of high school age and younger. In order to make NFHS rules skill-level and age-level appropriate, the rules may be modified by any organization that chooses to use them. Except as may be specifically noted in this rules book, the NFHS makes no recommendation about the nature or extent of the modifications that may be appropriate for children who are younger or less skilled than high school varsity athletes. Every individual using these rules is responsible for prudent judgment with respect to each contest, athlete and facility, and each athlete is responsible for exercising caution and good sportsmanship. These rules should be interpreted and applied so as to make reasonable accommodations for athletes, coaches and officials with disabilities. © 2023, By the National Federation of State High School Associations.

2023-24 Basketball Rules Changes (For comments on the 2023-24 rules changes, see page 77) 2-1-3 NOTE (NEW) — Requires the shot clock operator to sit at the scorer’s and timer’s table, if using a shot clock. 3-4-5 — Clarifies that teammates must all wear like-colored uniform bottoms but may wear multiple styles. 3-5-6 — Allows undershirts worn under visiting team jerseys to be black or the single solid color similar to the torso of the jersey. All teammates wearing undershirts must wear the same solid color. 4-8-1 — Eliminates the one-and-one for common fouls beginning with the sev- enth team foul in the half and establishes the bonus as two free throws awarded for a common foul beginning with the team’s fifth foul in each quarter and resets the fouls at the end of each quarter. 4-36, 6-4-3, 7-5-2 thru 4, 9-1 PENALTY 3, 9-4 PENALTY, 9-5 PENALTY, 9-6 PENALTY, 9-8 PENALTY, 9-9 PENALTY, 9-12 PENALTIES 3 & 4, 9-13 PENALTY — Establishes four throw-in spots (the nearest 28-foot mark along each sideline or the nearest spot 3-feet outside the lane line on the end line) when a team is retaining or gaining team control in its frontcourt due to a violation, a common foul prior to the bonus, or other stoppages in play other than an out of bounds. 7-6-6 — Allows the official administering a throw-in to the wrong team to cor- rect the mistake before the first dead ball after the ball becomes live unless there is a change of possession. 9-3-3 — Establishes that a player may step out of bounds without penalty un- less they are the first player to touch the ball after returning to the court or if they left the court to avoid a violation. 2023-24 Basketball Editorial Changes 2-1-1, 4-3-2, 4-19-13, Shot Clock Guidelines REMINDER: The style of the number may be the team jersey color when bordered with not more than two ¼-inch solid border(s) contrasting with the team jersey color, which shall be eliminated by 2024-25.

2023-24 Points of Emphasis Uniforms, Equipment and Apparel The NFHS regularly receives questions regarding the legality of uniforms, equipment and apparel. It is imperative that not only officials understand the rules governing uniforms and equipment, but coaches and players as well. Uniform jerseys must comply with the rules listed in 3-4, 3-5 and 3-6. The rules are concise and clear regarding what is and is not permissible on the jersey. An NFHS basketball uniform guide was created to illustrate the proper uniform design graphically. That document and an animated presentation can be found on the NFHS website. Uniforms A. Requests to make an exception to Rule 3-4, Uniforms (e.g., Pink Out night, Retro/ Throw Back night, Military Appreciation night) must be submitted to the state asso- ciation before the event for approval. Uniform requirements MAY NOT be altered by mutual agreement between schools or coaches. B. As has been the rule in the past, uniform bottoms do not have to match the torso of the uniform; however, with the adoption of Rule 3-4-5, uniform bottoms must be like-col- ored among teammates. To provide clarity, the following examples are provided: • Teammates may wear multiple styles of uniform bottoms, which may include shorts, skirts or pants. • The color of the uniform bottoms are not required to be the same as the uniform top; however, the bottoms must be a consistent color among teammates. The bot- tom style may differ for every player, but the color must be the same. Example – A1 is wearing a white jersey and red shorts. A2 is wearing a white jersey and a red skirt. Legal, as long as the bottom is red for all five players. C. Rolling and/or tucking of uniform bottoms is permissible, as long as the compression tights/sleeves, if worn, are color compliant. Equipment and Apparel A. Undershirts, if worn, must adhere to the following: • Home Team – Shall be white, shall be hemmed, and shall not have frayed or ragged edges. If the undershirt has sleeves, they shall be the same length. • Visiting Team – Shall be a single solid color similar to the torso of the jersey OR be solid black. The undershirt shall be hemmed and shall not have frayed or ragged edges. If the undershirt has sleeves, they shall be the same length. Team members may wear either a single solid color similar to the torso of the jersey or black, but not both. Example – Visitor B1 wears a purple jersey and a black undershirt. Visitor B2 is wearing a purple jersey and purple undershirt. Illegal. Both undershirts are a legal color; how- ever, teammates must wear the same color undershirt. This situation would be legal if all teammates wore a black undershirt or if all teammates wore a purple undershirt. B. Arm sleeves, knee sleeves, lower leg sleeves, compression shorts and tights are per- missible: • Anything worn on the arm and/or leg is a sleeve, except a knee brace, and shall meet the color restrictions. • The sleeves/tights and compression shorts shall be black, white, beige or the predomi- nant color of the jersey, and the same color sleeves/tights shall be worn by teammates. • All sleeves/tights and compression shorts shall be the same solid color and shall be the same solid color as any headband or wristband worn. Coaches and school administrators must ensure that legal uniforms are being ordered and purchased from manufacturers/distributors. If in doubt, PRIOR to purchasing uniforms, equipment or apparel, confirm legality with the local state association.

Bench Decorum The rules committee is concerned about bench decorum rule violations by coaches and bench personnel. Only through enforcing existing rules will coaches and bench personnel exhibit appropriate and acceptable behaviors. Coaches are expected to remain in the coach- ing box. The extension of the coaching box six years ago was intended to allow coaches to communicate with their players near the end line without violating the Coaching Box rule or creating a need to come onto the playing court. Coaches who go beyond the 28-foot line, or more importantly, onto the playing court, gain a distinct advantage, which is not within the spirit and intent of the rules. Coaches are reminded that while the bench area expands during a time-out, the bench area does not extend beyond the 28-foot line. Coaches and other bench personnel may not move to the expanded bench area until the time-out begins to ensure bench personnel do not create inadvertent contact with opposing players still out on the playing court. Coaches who leave the expanded bench area to engage officials inappropriately are subject to a warning or a bench technical foul. Misconduct by players, coaches and bench personnel is not permitted. There is continued support for officials to use all the tools at their disposal. These tools include promptly issuing an administrative warning for misconduct by coaches and bench personnel or assessing a technical foul if warranted. Players' taunting, baiting, finger-pointing, trash-talking, and using inappropriate gestures have increased during the past several seasons. Specifically, trendy hand gestures and body language meant to demean, and single-out opponents is not a reflection of good sporting behavior and has no place in the interscholastic setting. Players and coaches are permitted to celebrate an individual or team accomplishment, but they cannot direct that celebration toward their opponent. Also, players and coaches are not allowed to disrespectfully or inappropriately address and/or gesture at an official after a ruling is made on the court. Player and coach behavior, which in the official's judgment is determined to be a taunt of an opponent or a disrespectful act toward an official, shall be penalized by assessing a technical foul. Assistant coaches are not authorized to approach the scorer's table at any time. The head coach is permitted to go to the scorer's table to request a 60-second time-out to confer with personnel regarding a correctable error or to prevent or rectify a timing or scoring mistake/ error or an alternating possession mistake. Throw-Ins – Proper Locations Proper inbound spots contribute to the overall flow and fairness of the game. When the ball is inbounded from the correct location, it ensures that the offense and defense have an equal chance to contest the possession. It prevents teams from gaining an unfair advantage by manipulating the inbound spot, which could disrupt the balance of the game. Coaches design specific plays and offensive/defensive strategies based on where the ball will be put in play. It is, therefore, essential for game officials to be diligent in administering the ball at the proper throw-in location. With the adoption of Rules 7-5-2 through 7-5-4 coaches, players and officials are remind- ed of the following rules governing throw-in locations: A. Anytime a team causes the ball to go out of bounds in either the frontcourt or the backcourt, the throw-in occurs from the spot where the ball went out of bounds. B. When a violation by either team, a foul before the bonus by either team or dead ball (i.e., an inadvertent whistle or a held ball) occurs that will result in a throw-in, offi-

cials must ask themselves three questions: Where did the violation/foul occur? Is the throw-in team in its frontcourt or backcourt? Where was the ball when the interrup- tion occurred? 1. If the throw-in is to be in the team's frontcourt, it shall be at either the nearest 28- foot mark along each sideline or the nearest spot 3 feet outside the lane line and the end line. (Diagram 5) 2. If the throw-in is to be in the team's backcourt, the throw-in shall be at the desig- nated spot nearest to where the foul, violation or other stoppage in play occurred. End-of-Game Protocols As a game nears the end of playing time, officials need to remind each other of the game-ending procedures to prevent potential issues. Oftentimes, late game time-outs will provide the best opportunities to: A. Confirm the following with the scorer: 1. Accuracy of the official scorebook; 2. The number of time-outs remaining for each team (inform the head coach if the team has used its last time-out); 3. The number of team fouls and impact on the bonus. B. Remind the timer of the following: 1. Watch the officials for the clock-start and clock-stop signals; 2. Be prepared to assist in aiding the officials regarding whether a last-second shot was released prior to the end of time, especially if the gym is loud and the officials cannot hear the final horn. C. Officials should discuss the following: 1. Last-second shot responsibility (trail official 2-person, center/trail 3-person); 2. Unless the ball is tapped, no try can be attempted on a throw-in or free throw with three-tenths (.3) of a second or less remaining; 3. Intentional/flagrant fouls are two shots and a designated spot throw-in, as dis- cussed during the pre-game conference; 4. If a foul occurs as the game-ending horn sounds and the score can be tied or the game won by the ensuing free throws, the official must administer the free throws. If the free throws will not change the outcome, the free throws will not be attempted. D. If the score is tied at the end of regulation time, inform each team and the table officials of the overtime procedures (length of overtime period, additional 60-second time-out, etc.). E. Following the game-ending horn, the referee should confirm with the scorer that ev- erything is correct, then leave the floor with their partner(s). In situations when the score is separated by three points or less, it may be necessary to verbally confirm with the scorer. In games where the margin of victory is larger, a visual signal such as a thumbs-up will suffice. Be confident that everything is correct, as the officials' jurisdiction ends when they leave the visual confines of the playing court.

DIAGRAM 1 Basketball Court Diagram NOTE: Except as specifically stated in the rules, information on court diagrams in this book is suggestive only; it is not required by NFHS rules. The construction and layout of all courts and fields used for high school competition are subject to any controlling laws and building codes, and to the sound judgment of the persons in charge of the facilities.

Table 1 Supplement to Basketball Court Court Specifications: 1. If possible, building plans should provide for a court with ideal measurements as stated in Rule 1-1, ample out-of-bounds area and necessary seating space. A long court permits use of two crosswise courts for practice and informal games. 2. It is recommended that the area above the court be clear of any obstructions and be at least 25 feet or higher. 3. Instead of the 2-inch minimum boundaries, it is legal to use contrasting-col- ored floor areas by painting the out-of-bounds area, the center restraining circle, and the restricted parts of the free-throw lanes so that the mathemat- ical line between the two colors is the boundary. If such contrasting colored out-of-bounds belt is used, it should be at least 8 inches wide. 4. It is recommended that a belt 8 inches wide or more in width be used to mark the boundaries on all courts which have at least 10 feet of open space between the boundary lines and the seating. This plan is urged for all new construction and for other similar courts when the boundaries are remarked. 5. It is recommended that there be a 2-inch wide broken line consisting of 12- inch segments, 12 inches apart, of a color different from that of the boundary, at a minimum of 6 feet outside the court extending from sideline to sideline and parallel to the end line. 6. Coaching box – tableside. Bounded by a line drawn 28 feet from the end line towards the division line. A line, perpendicular to the 28-foot line and placed at each end, with a minimum length of 2 feet, shall be extended toward the team bench so that the coaching box boundary is evident. The same direc- tions should be followed for the other side of the scorer's table. NOTE: State associations may, on an individual basis, alter the length and allow alter- native bench locations. 7. The court should be uniformly and adequately lighted. Lighting engineers should be placed in charge of this important factor when planning any new in- stallations. For information on recommended specifications for lighting, you may contact: Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, 120 Wall St., 17th Floor, New York, NY 10005, 212-248-5000. FACILITIES Because facilities used for high school athletics come in many shapes, sizes and conditions, on-site event management may on occasion conclude that compliance with NFHS directives about event configuration is not feasible. Under all circumstances, on- site event management should utilize set-ups that minimize risk. If a given facility can- not be made reasonably hazard-free, the event should be relocated.

Rule 1-1 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules THE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THE RULES The restrictions which the rules place upon the players are intended to create a balance of play; to provide equal opportunity between the offense and the defense; to provide equal opportunity between the small player and tall player; to provide reasonable risk minimization; to create an atmosphere of sporting behavior and fair play; and to emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom of action of individual or team play on either offense or defense. Therefore, it is important to know the intent and purpose of a rule so that it may be intelligently applied in each play situation. A player or a team should not be permitted an advantage which is not intended by a rule. Neither should play be permitted to develop which may lead to placing a player at a disadvantage not intended by a rule. It is the policy of the NFHS Basketball Rules Committee that there be no devia- tion from the rules unless experimental approval has been granted by the NFHS liaison to the rules committee. THE GAME – Basketball is played by two teams of five players each. The pur- pose of each team is to throw the ball into its own basket and to prevent the other team from scoring. The ball may be thrown, batted, rolled or dribbled in any direction, subject to restrictions laid down in the following rules. Page 10 r Rule 1 Court and Equipment The NFHS does not perform scientific tests on any specific items of equipment to de- termine if the equipment poses undue risks to student-athletes, coaches, officials or spectators. Such determinations are the responsibility of equipment manufacturers. SECTION 1 PLAYING COURT DIMENSIONS The playing court shall be a rectangular surface free from obstructions and with dimensions not greater than 94 feet in length by 50 feet in width. IDEAL MEA- SUREMENTS ARE: High School Age – 84 by 50 feet. These are the dimensions for the playing court only. Suggestions about construction and lighting are in Diagram 1. SECTION 2 SIDELINES, END LINES ART. 1 . . . The playing court shall be marked with sidelines, end lines and other lines as shown in Diagram 1. There shall be at least 3 feet (and preferably 10 feet) of unobstructed space outside boundaries. The sidelines and end lines shall be a minimum of 2 inches in width. If it is desirable to use contrasting colored-floor areas instead of the lines, see Table 1, No. 3.

Page 11 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 1-3 ART. 2 . . . If, on an unofficial court, there is less than 3 feet of unobstructed space outside any sideline or end line, a narrow broken line shall be marked on the court parallel with and 3 feet inside that boundary. This restraining line becomes the boundary line during a throw-in on that side or end, as in Rule 7-6. It contin- ues to be the boundary until the ball crosses the line. SECTION 3 CENTER RESTRAINING CIRCLE, DIVISION LINE ART. 1 . . . A restraining circle shall be drawn at the center of the court with a radius of 6 feet measured to the outside edge. The edge of the circle shall be des- ignated with a minimum of a ¼-inch-wide single line but no wider than 2 inches. See Table 1, No. 3 if the use of contrasting colored-floor areas instead of a line is desirable. Spaces for nonjumpers around the center circle are 36 inches deep. ART. 2 . . . A division line 2 inches wide, shall divide the court into two equal parts. If the court is less than 74 feet long, it should be divided by two lines, each parallel to and 40 feet from the farther end line. ART. 3 . . . Shadow-bordered lines are permissible. A shadow line is a line that designates the required width by use of border or outline lines at least ¼-inch wide, which shall lie within the required width. Border lines that are the natural color of the court are permissible. The area within these lines need not be one col- or, but the continuous outline shall be clearly visible to the officials. If the floor has a logo in the center of the court, that logo should not distract from the visibility of the division line or center circle. SECTION 4 THREE-POINT LINE ART. 1 . . . A three-point line, 2 inches wide in the form of a semicircle, shall be drawn at each end of the court as shown in Diagram 1. The semicircle has a radius of 19 feet 9 inches from a point in the middle of the free-throw lane directly below the center of the basket to the outside edge of the line. The semicircle shall be extended with a 2-inch wide line perpendicular to the end line, the length of which shall be 63 inches from the inside edge of the end line. ART. 2 . . . The three-point line shall be the same color as the free-throw lane boundary lines and free-throw semicircle. SECTION 5 FREE-THROW LANE ART. 1 . . . A free-throw lane, 12 feet wide measured to the outside of each lane boundary, and the semicircle with the free-throw line as a diameter, shall be marked at each end of the court with dimensions and markings as shown in Diagram 1. All lines designating the free-throw lane, but not lane-space marks are part of the lane. ART. 2 . . . The lane-space marks (2 inches by 8 inches) identify areas which extend 36 inches from the outer edge of the lane lines toward the sidelines. There are three lane spaces on each lane boundary line.

Rule 1-6 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 12 ART. 3 . . . The free-throw lane line and semicircle shall be the same color as the three-point line. See Table 1, No. 3 if the use of contrasting colored-floor areas instead of the lines is desirable. SECTION 6 FREE-THROW LINE A free-throw line, 2 inches wide, shall be drawn across both semicircles, which have an outside radius of 6 feet as shown in Diagram 1. It shall be parallel to the end line and shall have its farthest edge 15 feet from the plane of the face of the backboard. SECTION 7 BACKBOARDS ART. 1 . . . The backboards shall be the same size at both ends of the court. The backboard shall be one of three types: (1) a rectangle 6 feet horizontally and 4 feet vertically; or (2) a rectangle 6 feet horizontally and 3½ feet vertically; or (3) a fan- shaped backboard, 54-inches wide and with dimensions as shown in Diagram 2. NOTE: The 6-foot horizontal and 3½-foot vertical dimensions are recommended for re- placement backboards or new installations. ART. 2 . . . Each of the backboards shall be of any rigid material. The front surface shall be flat and, unless it is transparent, it shall be white. Tinted glass backboards are prohibited. Diagram 2 gives specifications for the three types of backboards. See Rule 1, Sections 7, 8, 9. It is not legal to paint a fan-shaped board on a rectangular back- board. NOTE: For the fan-shaped backboard in transparent material, the recurved cut-out at the bottom may be filled in and the ring attached to the front of the backboard. ART. 3 . . . If the backboard is transparent, it shall be marked as follows: A rectangle shall be centered behind the ring and marked by a 2-inch white line. The rectangle shall have outside dimensions of 24 inches horizontally and 18 inches vertically. For the rectangular backboard, the top edge of the backboard shall be level with the ring. For the fan-shaped backboard, the baseline shall be omitted, and the two vertical lines shall be extended to the bottom of the backboard. The rectangular target in a bright orange or black color may be used on a nontrans- parent backboard. The border of the backboard shall be marked with a white line. The border shall be 3 inches or less in width.

No logo, marking, lettering, etc., is permitted on the backboard, backboard padding, or basket. SECTION 8 BACKBOARD POSITION ART. 1 . . . Each backboard shall be midway between the sidelines, with the plane of its front face perpendicular to the floor, parallel to the end line, and 4 feet from it. ART. 2 . . . The upper edge of the backboard shall be 13 feet above the floor for the rectangular, and 12 feet 8 inches for the fan-shaped. The backboard shall be protected from spectators to a distance of at least 3 feet at each end. SECTION 9 BACKBOARD PADDING, SUPPORT SYSTEMS ART. 1 . . . The bottom and each side of the all-rectangular backboards shall be padded with a poly high-carb vinyl-type material that meets the Bashor resilience test with a range of 20-30. The padding shall cover the bottom surface of the board and the side surface to a distance of 15 inches up from the bottom. The front and back surfaces shall be covered to a minimum distance of ¾ inch from the bottom of the backboard. The padding shall be 1 inch thick from the front and back surfaces of the backboard. The material shall be 2 inches from the bottom edge of the backboard. It is recommended that the padding be mounted on the backboard by adhesive or material such as Velcro, channel, etc. The padding shall be a single, solid color and shall be the same color on both backboards.

Rule 1-10 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 14 ART. 2 . . . Any backboard support behind the backboard and at a height of less than 9 feet above the floor shall be padded on the bottom surface to a distance of 2 feet from the face of the backboard. All portable backstops shall have the bases padded to a height of 7 feet on the court-side surface. ART. 3 . . . Clearances – As below and behind backboards, all support systems should be at least 8 feet behind the plane of the backboard face and at a height of 7 feet or more above the floor. ART. 4 . . . Any backboard support, all of which is not directly behind the back- board, should be at least 6 inches behind it if the support extends above the top and at least 2 feet behind it if the support extends beyond the side. Any overhead backboard support structure which shall be forward-braced due to space limita- tions, architectural or structural restraints, shall meet the following requirements: A front, diagonal-brace system shall be located above a line extending upward and into the playing court at a maximum 45-degree angle from a point on a vertical line located a minimum of 6 inches behind the front side of the backboard at a minimum height of 4 feet 6 inches above the basket ring. ART. 5 . . . Warning on misuse of portable backstops – Manufacturers and administrators should be aware of an "extreme-caution" warning relative to the misuse of portable backstops. A high degree of injury potential and a severe lia- bility problem exists when players or spectators are allowed to hang, sit or stand on the basket ring or backboard. Administrators shall see that this practice is eliminated or that the portable units are lowered at the completion of the game. There is a high risk of severe injury, even death, if this practice is allowed to occur. A recommended warning or inscription such as "Danger – please do not get on the ring/backboard" is desirable. SECTION 10 BASKET SIZE, MATERIAL ART. 1 . . . Each basket shall consist of a single metal ring, 18 inches in inside diameter, its flange and braces, and a white-cord 12-mesh net, 15 to 18 inches in length, suspended from beneath the ring. ART. 2 . . . Each ring shall not be more than 5/8 inch in diameter, with the pos- sible addition of small-gauge loops on the bottom edge for attaching a 12-mesh net. The ring and its attaching flange and braces shall be bright orange in color. ART. 3 . . . The cord of the net shall be not less than 120-thread nor more than 144-thread twine, or plastic material of comparable dimensions with no additional extensions. It shall be constructed to momentarily check the ball as it passes through. SECTION 11 BASKET RING ART. 1 . . . Each basket ring shall be securely attached to the backboard/sup- port system with a ring-restraining device. Such a device shall ensure that the basket stays attached in the event a glass backboard breaks. Each basket ring

Page 15 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules shall have its upper edge 10 feet above and parallel to the floor and shall be equi- distant from the vertical edges of the backboard. The nearest point of the inside edge of the ring shall be 6 inches from the plane of the face of the backboard. ART. 2 . . . Positive-lock breakaway, flex breakaway and fixed rings are legal. Breakaway basket rings shall have rebound characteristics similar to those of fixed rings. The pressure-release mechanism should ensure these characteristics, as well as protect both the ring and backboard. The design of the ring and its construction should ensure player safety. ART. 3 . . . For those rings with a breakaway mechanism, the pressure-release mechanism shall be preset so that rings do not deflect more than ½ inch when subjected to static load of 50 pounds and may be sealed or field adjustable. When released, the positive-lock breakaway ring shall not rotate more than 30 degrees below the original horizontal position. After release and with the load no longer ap- plied, the ring shall return automatically and instantaneously to the original position. NOTE: It is recommended that schools have the basket rings tested for rules compliance. SECTION 12 BALL ART. 1 . . . The ball shall meet the following specifications: a. Its solid color shall be Pantone Matching System (PMS) Orange 151, Red-Orange 173 or Brown 1535. b. It shall be spherical. c. It shall have a deeply-pebbled, granulated surface with horizontally shaped panels bonded tightly to the rubber carcass. d. The circumference shall be: 1.

The free throws for a noncommon foul. c. A common foul before the bonus free throws are in effect. NOTE: This procedure is used only to establish the alternating-possession procedure. See Rule 6-4 for using the procedure and reversing the possession arrow. SECTION 4 BALL LOCATION LOCATION/STATUS, AT DISPOSAL ART. 1 . . . A ball which is in contact with a player or with the court is in the backcourt if either the ball or the player (either player if the ball is touching more than one) is touching the backcourt. ART. 2 . . . A ball which is in contact with a player or with the court is in the frontcourt if neither the ball nor the player is touching the backcourt. ART. 3 . . . A ball which is in flight retains the same location/status as when it was last in contact with a player or the court. ART. 4 . . . A ball which touches a player or an official is the same as the ball touching the floor at that individual's location/status. ART. 5 . . .

EXCEPTION: In Arts. 1 or 2, if a player has a hand legally in contact with the ball, it is not a violation if such contact with the ball continues after it enters the imaginary cylinder or if in such action, the player touches the basket. Dunking or stuffing is legal and is not basket interference. ART. 3 . . . Touches the ball outside the cylinder while reaching through the basket from below. ART. 4 . . . Pulls down a movable ring so that it contacts the ball before the ring returns to its original position. SECTION 7 BLOCKING, CHARGING ART. 1 . . .

If a guard has obtained a legal guarding position, the player with the ball shall get head and shoulders past the torso of the defensive player. If contact occurs on the torso of the defensive player, the dribbler is responsible for the contact. c. There shall be reasonable space between two defensive players or a defen- sive player and a boundary line to allow the dribbler to continue in the drib- ber's path. If there is less than 3 feet of space, the dribbler has the greater responsibility for the contact. d. The player with the ball may not push the torso of the guard to gain an advantage to pass, shoot or dribble. SECTION 8 BONUS FREE THROWS ART. 1 . . . The bonus is the two free throws awarded for a common foul (ex- cept a player-control or team-control foul) as follows: a. Beginning with a team's fifth foul in each quarter, two free throws are awarded, regardless of whether or not the first free throw is successful. b.

A closely guarded count shall be terminated when the offensive player in control of the ball gets head and shoulders past the defensive player. SECTION 11 CONTINUOUS MOTION ART. 1 . . . Continuous motion applies to a try or tap for field goals and free throws, but it has no significance unless there is a foul by any defensive player during the interval which begins when the habitual throwing movement starts a try or with the touching on a tap and ends when the ball is clearly in flight. ART. 2 . . . If an opponent fouls after a player has started a try or tap for field goal, the player is permitted to complete the customary arm movement, and if pivoting or stepping when fouled, may complete the usual foot or body movement in any activity while holding the ball. These privileges are granted only when the usual throwing motion has started before the foul occurs and before the ball is in flight. ART. 3 . . . Continuous motion does not apply if a teammate fouls after a player has started a try or tap for field goal and before the ball is in flight. The ball be- comes dead immediately. SECTION 12 CONTROL, PLAYER AND TEAM ART. 1 . . . A player is in control of the ball when the player is holding or dribbling a live ball.

Neither team control nor player control exists during a dead ball, a jump ball or when the ball is in flight during a try or tap for a field goal.

Rule 4-13 SECTION 13 COURT AREAS ART. 1 . . .

A player touches the ball outside the cylinder during a free-throw attempt. SECTION 23 GUARDING ART. 1 . . . Guarding is the act of legally placing the body in the path of an offen- sive opponent. There is no minimum distance required between the guard and op- ponent, but the maximum is 6 feet when closely guarded. Every player is entitled to a spot on the playing court provided such player gets there first without illegally contacting an opponent. A player who extends an arm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent is not considered to have a legal position if contact occurs. ART. 2 . . . To obtain an initial legal guarding position: a. The guard shall have both feet touching the playing court. b. The front of the guard's torso shall be facing the opponent. ART. 3 . . .

Rule 4-24 SECTION 24 HANDS AND ARMS, LEGAL AND ILLEGAL USE ART. 1 . . . It is legal to extend the arms vertically above the shoulders and need not be lowered to avoid contact with an opponent when the action of the opponent causes contact. This legal use of the arms and hands usually occurs when guard- ing the player making a throw-in, the player with the ball in pressing tactics and a player with the ball who is maneuvering to try for goal by pivoting, jumping, etc. ART. 2 . . . It is legal use of hands to reach to block or slap the ball controlled by a dribbler or a player throwing for goal or a player holding it and accidentally hitting the hand of the opponent when it is in contact with the ball. ART. 3 . . . It is legal to hold the hands and arms in front of the face or body for protection and to absorb force from an imminent charge by an opponent. This same protective use of the arms and hands occurs when a player who has set a screen outside the opponent's visual field is about to be run into by the player being screened. The action, however, should be a recoil action rather than a pushing action. ART. 4 . . . It is not legal to use hands and arms or hips and shoulders to force through a screen or to hold the screener and then to push the screener aside in order to maintain a guarding position relative to the opponent. ART. 5 . . . It is not legal to use hands on an opponent which in any way inhibits the freedom of movement of the opponent or acts as an aid to a player in starting or stopping. ART. 6 . . . It is not legal to extend the arms fully or partially in a position other than vertical so that the freedom of movement of an opponent is hindered when contact with the arms occurs. The extension of the elbows when the hands are on the hips or when the hands are held near the chest or when the arms are held more or less horizontally are examples of the illegal positions used. ART. 7 . . . It is not legal to use the hand and/or forearm to prevent an opponent from attacking the ball during a dribble or when throwing for goal. ART. 8 . . . It is not legal to swing arms and elbows excessively. This occurs when: a. Arms and elbows are swung about while using the shoulders as pivots, and the speed of the extended arms and elbows is in excess of the rest of the body as it rotates on the hips or on the pivot foot. b. The aggressiveness with which the arms and elbows are swung could cause injury to another player if contacted.Using this description as a basis, an official will promptly and unhesitatingly rule such action with arms and elbows a violation. ART. 9 . . . It is not legal to lock arms or grasp a teammate(s) in an effort to restrict the movement of an opponent. 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 38

Page 39 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 4-25 SECTION 25 HELD BALL A held ball occurs when: ART. 1 . . . Opponents have their hands so firmly on the ball that control cannot be obtained without undue roughness. ART. 2 . . . An opponent places a hand(s) on the ball and prevents an airborne player from throwing the ball or releasing it on a try or tap for field goal. SECTION 26 HOLDING Holding is illegal personal contact with an opponent which interferes with the opponent's freedom of movement. SECTION 27 INCIDENTAL CONTACT Incidental contact is contact with an opponent which is permitted and which does not constitute a foul. ART. 1 . . . The mere fact that contact occurs does not constitute a foul. When 10 players are moving rapidly in a limited area, some contact is certain to occur. ART. 2 . . . Contact, which may result when opponents are in equally favorable positions to perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal, even though the contact may be severe. ART. 3 . . . Contact, which does not hinder the opponent from participating in normal defensive or offensive movements, should be considered incidental. ART. 4 . . . A player who is screened within the player's visual field is expected to avoid contact with the screener by stopping or going around the screener. In cases of screens outside the visual field, the opponent may make inadvertent con- tact with the screener, and such contact is to be ruled incidental contact, provided the screener is not displaced if the screener has the ball. ART. 5 . . . If a player approaches an opponent from behind or from a position from which the player has no reasonable chance to play the ball without making contact with the opponent, the responsibility is on the player in the unfavorable position. SECTION 28 JUMP BALL ART. 1 . . . A jump ball is a method of putting the ball into play to start the game and each extra period by tossing it up between two opponents in the center restraining circle, or as in Rule 7-3 before the alternating-possession procedure has been established. ART. 2 . . . The jump ball begins when the ball leaves the official's hand(s) and ends when the touched ball contacts a nonjumper, an official or the floor. SECTION 29 KICKING THE BALL Kicking the ball is intentionally striking it with any part of the leg or foot.

Rule 4-30 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 40 SECTION 30 MULTIPLE THROW A multiple throw is a succession of free throws attempted by the same team. SECTION 31 PASS A pass is movement of the ball caused by a player who throws, bats or rolls the ball to another player. SECTION 32 PENALTY A penalty is an action assessed by an official to a player or team for a rules infraction. See Rules 9 and 10. SECTION 33 PIVOT A pivot takes place when a player who is holding the ball steps once, or more than once, in any direction with the same foot while the other foot, called the pivot foot, is kept at its point of contact with the floor. SECTION 34 PLAYERS/BENCH PERSONNEL/SUBSTITUTES/TEAM MEMBERS ART. 1 . . . A player is one of five team members who are legally on the court at any given time, except intermission. ART. 2 . . . Bench personnel are all individuals who are part of or affiliated with a team, including, but not limited to: substitutes, coaches, manager(s) and statistician(s). During an intermission, all team members are bench personnel for the purpose of penalizing unsporting behavior. ART. 3 . . . A substitute becomes a player when the substitute legally enters the court. If entry is not legal, the substitute becomes a player when the ball becomes live. A player becomes bench personnel after the substitute becomes a player or after notification of the coach following the player's disqualification. ART. 4 . . . A team member is a member of bench personnel who is in uniform and is eligible to become a player. SECTION 35 PLAYER LOCATION/STATUS ART. 1 . . . The location/status of a player or nonplayer is determined by where the person is touching the floor as far as being: a. Inbounds or out-of-bounds. b. In the frontcourt or backcourt. c. Outside (behind/beyond) or inside the three-point field-goal line. ART. 2 . . . When a player is touching the backcourt, out of bounds or the three-point line, the player is located in backcourt, out of bounds or inside the three-point line, respectively. ART. 3 . . . The location/status of an airborne player with reference to the three factors of Article 1 is the same as at the time such player was last in contact with the floor or an extension of the floor, such as a bleacher.

Page 41 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 4-36 SECTION 36 POINT OF INTERRUPTION ART. 1 . . . Method of resuming play due to an official's inadvertent whistle, an interrupted game, as in Rule 5-4-4, a correctable error, as in Rule 2-10-6, a double personal, double technical or simultaneous foul, as in Rules 4-19-8 and 4-19-10. ART. 2 . . . Play shall be resumed by one of the following methods: a. A throw-in to the team that was in control: 1. In the frontcourt at one of the four designated spots nearest to where the ball was located when the interruption occurred. (Diagram 5) 2. In the backcourt at an out-of-bounds spot nearest to where the ball was located when the interruption occurred. b. A free throw or a throw-in when the interruption occurred during this activ- ity or if a team is entitled to such. c. A jump ball or alternating-possession throw-in when neither team is in con- trol and no goal, infraction, nor end of quarter/extra period is involved when the game is interrupted. ART. 3 . . . When the ball remains live after a violation or foul (as in Rule 4-19- 8) during a try or tap for field goal, the point of interruption is determined to be when the ball becomes dead following the violation or foul. SECTION 37 REBOUNDING ART. 1 . . . Rebounding is an attempt by any player to secure possession of the ball following a try or tap for field goal. In a rebounding situation there is no player or team control. ART. 2 . . . To obtain or maintain legal rebounding position, a player may not: a. Displace, charge or push an opponent. b. Extend shoulders, hips, knees or extend the arms or elbows fully or partially in a position other than vertical so that the freedom of movement of an opponent is hindered when contact with the arms or elbows occurs. c. Bend the body in an abnormal position to hold or displace an opponent. d. Violate the principle of verticality. ART. 3 . . . Every player is entitled to a spot on the playing court, provided the player gets there first without illegally contacting an opponent. SECTION 38 RESUMPTION-OF-PLAY PROCEDURE The resumption-of-play procedure is used to prevent delay in putting the ball in play when a throw-in team does not make a thrower available or following a time-out or intermission (unless either team is not on the court to start the second half) as in Rules 7-5-1 and 8-1-2. The procedure results in a violation instead of a technical foul for initial delay in specific situations. SECTION 39 RULE ART. 1 . . . A rule is one of a group of regulations which governs the game.

Rule 4-40 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 42 ART. 2 . . . A game regulation, commonly called a rule, sometimes states or implies that the ball is dead or a foul or violation is involved. If it does not, it is as- sumed the ball is live and no foul or violation has occurred to affect the situation. ART. 3 . . . A single infraction is not complicated by a second infraction unless so stated or implied. SECTION 40 SCREEN ART. 1 . . . A screen is legal action by a player who, while touching the playing court, without causing contact, delays or prevents an opponent from reaching a desired position. ART. 2 . . . To establish a legal screening position: a. The screener may face any direction. b. Time and distance are relevant. c. The screener shall be stationary, except when both the screener and oppo- nent are moving in the same path and the same direction. d. The screener shall stay within the screener's vertical plane with a stance approximately shoulder width apart. ART. 3 . . . When screening a stationary opponent from the front or side (within the visual field), the screener may be anywhere short of contact. ART. 4 . . . When screening a stationary opponent from behind (outside the visual field), the screener shall allow the opponent one normal step backward without contact. ART. 5 . . . When screening a moving opponent, the screener shall allow the opponent time and distance to avoid contact by stopping or changing direction. The speed of the player to be screened will determine where the screener may take a stationary position. The position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from the opponent. ART. 6 . . . When screening an opponent who is moving in the same path and direction as the screener, the player behind is responsible if contact is made because the player in front slows up or stops and the player behind overruns the opponent. ART. 7 . . . A player who is screened within the player's visual field is expected to avoid contact by going around the screener. In cases of screens outside the visual field, the opponent may make inadvertent contact with the screener and if the opponent is running rapidly, the contact may be severe. Such a case is to be ruled as incidental contact provided the opponent stops or attempts to stop on contact and moves around the screen, and provided the screener is not displaced if the screener has the ball. ART. 8 . . . A player may not use the arms, hands, hips or shoulders to force through a screen or to hold the screener and then push the screener aside in order to maintain a guarding position on an opponent.

Page 43 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 4-41 SECTION 41 SHOOTING, TRY, TAP ART. 1 . . . The act of shooting begins simultaneously with the start of the try or tap for field goal and ends when the ball is clearly in flight, and includes the airborne shooter. ART. 2 . . . A try for field goal is an attempt by a player to score two or three points by throwing the ball into a team's own basket. A player is trying for goal when the player has the ball and in the official's judgment is throwing or attempt- ing to throw for goal. It is not essential that the ball leave the player's hand as a foul could prevent release of the ball. ART. 3 . . . The try starts when the player begins the motion which habitually precedes the release of the ball. ART. 4 . . . The try ends when the throw is successful, when it is certain the throw is unsuccessful, when the thrown ball touches the floor or when the ball becomes dead. ART. 5 . . . A tap for field goal is the contacting of the ball with any part of a player's hand(s) in an attempt to direct the ball into the basket. ART. 6 . . . A tap for field goal shall be considered the same as a try for field goal, except as in Rule 5-2-5. ART. 7 . . . The tap for field goal starts when the player's hand(s) touches the ball. ART. 8 . . . The tap for field goal ends in exactly the same manner as a try. SECTION 42 THROW-IN, THROWER, DESIGNATED SPOT ART. 1 . . . The thrower is the player who attempts to make a throw-in. ART. 2 . . . A throw-in is a method of putting the ball in play from out-of-bounds. ART. 3 . . . The throw-in and the throw-in count begin when the ball is at the disposal of a player of the team entitled to it. ART. 4 . . . The throw-in count ends when the ball is released by the thrower so the passed ball goes directly into the court. ART. 5 . . . The throw-in ends when: a. The passed ball touches or is legally touched by another player inbounds. b. The passed ball touches or is touched by another player out-of-bounds, except as in Rule 7-5-7. c. The throw-in team commits a throw-in violation. ART. 6 . . . The designated throw-in spot is 3 feet wide with no depth limita- tion and is established and signaled by the official prior to putting the ball at the thrower's disposal. NOTE: The thrower shall keep one foot on or over the designated spot until the ball is released. The traveling and dribbling rules are not in effect for a throw-in.

Rule 4-43 SECTION 43 TIME-OUT ART. 1 . . . A 60-second time-out charged to a team is a maximum of one minute in length. A 30-second time-out charged to a team is a maximum 30 seconds in length. A warning is sounded 15 seconds prior to the expiration of the 30 or 60 seconds. ART. 2 . . . A successive time-out is one which is granted to either team before the clock has started following the previous time-out. SECTION 44 TRAVELING Traveling is moving a foot or feet in any direction in excess of prescribed limits while holding the ball. The limits on foot movements are as follows: ART. 1 . . . A player who catches the ball with both feet on the floor may pivot using either foot. When one foot is lifted, the other is the pivot foot. ART. 2 . . . A player who catches the ball while moving or dribbling may stop and establish a pivot foot as follows: a. If both feet are off the floor and the player lands: 1. Simultaneously on both feet, either foot may be the pivot. 2. On one foot followed by the other, the first foot to touch is the pivot. 3. On one foot, the player may jump off that foot and simultaneously land on both. Neither foot can be a pivot in this case. b. If one foot is on the floor: 1. It is the pivot when the other foot touches in a step. 2. The player may jump off that foot and simultaneously land on both. Neither foot can be a pivot in this case. ART. 3 . . . After coming to a stop and establishing a pivot foot: a. The pivot foot may be lifted, but not returned to the floor, before the ball is released on a pass or try for goal. b. If the player jumps, neither foot may be returned to the floor before the ball is released on a pass or try for goal. c. The pivot foot may not be lifted before the ball is released to start a dribble. ART. 4 . . . After coming to a stop when neither foot can be a pivot: a. One or both feet may be lifted, but may not be returned to the floor before the ball is released on a pass or try for goal. b. Neither foot may be lifted before the ball is released to start a dribble. ART. 5 . . . A player holding the ball: a. May not touch the floor with a knee or any other part of the body other than hand or foot. b. After gaining control while on the floor and touching with other than hand or foot, may not attempt to get up or stand. SECTION 45 VERTICALITY Verticality applies to a legal position. Following are the basic components of the principle of verticality: ART. 1 . . . Legal guarding position shall be obtained initially and movement thereafter shall be legal. 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 44

Page 45 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 4-46 ART. 2 . . . From this position, the defender may rise or jump vertically and occupy the space within the defender's vertical plane. ART. 3 . . . The hands and arms of the defender may be raised within the de- fender's vertical plane while on the floor or in the air. ART. 4 . . . The defender should not be penalized for leaving the floor vertically or having hands and arms extended within the defender's vertical plane. ART. 5 . . . The offensive player whether on the floor or airborne, may not "clear out" or cause contact within the defender's vertical plane, which is a foul. ART. 6 . . . . The defender may not "belly up" or use the lower part of the body or arms to cause contact outside the defender's vertical plane, which is a foul. ART. 7 . . . The player with the ball is to be given no more protection or consid- eration than the defender in judging which player has violated the rules. SECTION 46 VIOLATION A violation is one of three types of rule infractions which are listed and the penalty outlined in Rules 9-1 through 13. Following are the types of violations: ART. 1 . . . Type 1: Floor violations including basket interference by a teammate of the player attempting a field goal or free throw or goaltending a field goal and other violations, which are not connected with a free throw or try or tap for field goal. ART. 2 . . . Type 2: Basket interference or goaltending by a player at the oppo- nent's basket. ART. 3 . . . Type 3: Free-throw violations other than those involving basket interference or goaltending. SECTION 47 WARNING FOR DELAY A warning to a team for delay is an administrative procedure by an official which is recorded in the scorebook by the scorer and reported to the head coach: ART. 1 . . . For throw-in plane violations, as in Rules 9-2-10 and 10-2-1c. ART. 2 . . . For huddle by either team and contact with the free thrower, as in Rule 10-2-1d. ART. 3 . . . For interfering with the ball following a goal as in Rule 10-2-1e. ART. 4 . . . For failure to have the court ready for play following any time-out as in Rule 10-2-1f. SECTION 48 WARNING FOR COACH/TEAM CONDUCT A warning to a head coach/bench personnel for misconduct is an administrative procedure by an official, which is recorded in the scorebook by the scorer and reported to the head coach. ART. 1 . . . For conduct, such as that described in Rule 10-5, Articles 1 (a, b d, e, f), 2 and 4, the official shall warn the head coach unless the offense is judged to be major, in which case a technical foul shall be assessed. NOTE: A warning is not required prior to calling a technical foul.

Rule 5-1 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 46 ART. 2 . . . For the first violation of Rule 10-6-1, the official shall warn the head coach unless the offense is judged to be major, in which case a technical foul shall be assessed. NOTE: A warning is not required prior to calling a technical foul. r Rule 5 Scoring and Timing Regulations SECTION 1 GOAL ART. 1 . . . A goal is made when a live ball enters the basket from above and remains in or passes through. No goal is scored if an untouched throw-in goes through the basket. ART. 2 . . . Whether the clock is running or stopped has no influence on the counting of a goal. If a player-control foul occurs before or after a goal, the goal is canceled. SECTION 2 SCORING ART. 1 . . . A successful try, tap or thrown ball from the field by a player who is located behind the team's own 19-foot, 9-inch arc counts three points. A ball that touches the floor, a teammate inside the arc, an official, or any other goal from the field counts two points for the team into whose basket the ball is thrown. (4-5-4) ART. 2 . . . A goal from a free throw counts one point for the free-thrower's team and is credited to the free thrower. (4-20-1) ART. 3 . . . If a player scores a field goal in the opponent's basket, it is not credited to a player, but is indicated in a footnote. (4-5-4) ART. 4 . . . The only infractions for which points are awarded are goaltending by the defense or basket interference at the opponent's basket. ART. 5 . . . When play is resumed with a throw-in or free throw and three-tenths (.3) of a second or less remains on the clock, a player may not gain control of the ball and try for a field goal. In this situation only a tap could score. NOTE: This rule does not apply if the clock does not display tenths of a second. SECTION 3 WINNING TEAM The winning team is the one which has accumulated the greater number of points when the game ends, as in Rule 2-2-4. SECTION 4 FORFEITURE, PROTEST, INTERRUPTED GAME ART. 1 . . . Unless state association rules determine otherwise, a game shall be declared a forfeit when: a. A team refuses to play after being instructed to do so by an official. b. A coach is removed from the premises for unsporting conduct and no au- thorized school personnel is present to assume responsibility for the team.

Page 47 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Rule 5-5 c. Any player, team member, bench personnel or coach fails to comply with any technical foul penalty, or repeatedly commits technical-foul infractions or other acts which make a travesty of the game. ART. 2 . . . If the team to which the game is forfeited is ahead, the score at the time of forfeiture must stand. If this team is not ahead, the score must be record- ed as 2-0 in its favor. ART. 3 . . . The NFHS Basketball Rules Committee does not recognize protests. ART. 4 . . . Whenever a game is interrupted because of events beyond the control of the responsible administrative authorities, it shall be continued from the point of interruption unless the teams agree to terminate the game with the existing score, or there are conference, league or state association rules to cover the situation. SECTION 5 LENGTH OF QUARTER ART. 1 . . . Playing time for teams of high school age shall be four quarters of eight minutes each with intermissions of one minute after the first and third quar- ters, and 10 minutes between halves. The halftime intermission may be extended to a maximum of 15 minutes for special activities, provided home management has properly notified the visiting team prior to the start of the game. ART. 2 . . . An organization sponsoring games involving teams which combine ninth-grade students with students in the eighth and/or seventh grades, may play those games in quarters of eight minutes. ART. 3 . . . A quarter(s) may be shortened in an emergency or at any time by mutual agreement of the opposing coaches and the referee. NOTE: By state association adoption, a running clock may be instituted when a specified point differential is reached at a specified time in the game. SECTION 6 BEGINNING, ENDING A QUARTER OR EXTRA PERIOD ART. 1 . . . Each quarter or extra period begins when the ball first becomes live. ART. 2 . . . Each quarter or extra period ends when the signal illuminates or sounds indicating time has expired, as in Rule 1-14. EXCEPTIONS: 1. If the ball is in flight during a try or tap for field goal, the quarter or extra period ends when the try or tap ends. 2. If a held ball or violation occurs so near the expiration of time that the clock is not stopped before time expires, the quarter or extra period ends with the held ball or violation. 3. If a foul occurs so near the expiration of time that the timer cannot get the clock stopped before time expires or after time expires, but while the ball is in flight during a try or tap for field goal, the quarter or extra period ends when the free throw(s) and all related activity have been completed. No penalty or part of a penalty carries over from one quarter or extra period to the next, except when a correctable error, as in Rule 2-10, is rectified. No free throw(s) shall be attempted after time has expired for the fourth quarter or any extra period, unless the point(s) would affect the outcome of the game. 4. If a technical foul occurs after the ball becomes dead to end a quarter or extra period, the next quarter or extra period is started by administering the free throws. If the fourth

Rule 5-7 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 48 quarter or extra period ends and the score is tied, the free throws will start the extra period. If the score is not tied and the results of the free throws would tie or win the game, the free throws are administered as part of the preceding quarter/period. SECTION 7 EXTRA PERIOD ART. 1 . . . If the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, play shall con- tinue without change of baskets for one or more extra periods with a one-minute intermission before each extra period. ART. 2 . . . The game ends if, at the end of any extra period, the score is not tied. ART. 3 . . . The length of each extra period shall be four minutes (or half the time of a regulation quarter for non-varsity contests). As many such periods as are necessary to break the tie shall be played. Extra periods are an extension of the fourth quarter. ART. 4 . . . Once the ball becomes live in the extra period, it will be played even though a correction in the fourth quarter score is made. SECTION 8 TIME-OUT, STOPPING PLAY Time-out occurs and the clock, if running, shall be stopped when an official: ART. 1 . . . Signals: a. A foul. b. A held ball. c. A violation. d. A time-out. ART. 2 . . . Stops play: a. Because of an injury as in Rules 3-3-6, 3-3-7 and 3-3-8. b. To confer with the scorer or timer. c. Because of unusual delay in getting a dead ball live. d. For any other situations or any emergency. NOTE: When a player is injured as in Article 2(a), the official may suspend play after the ball is dead or is in control of the injured player's team or when the opponents complete a play. A play is completed when a team loses control (including throwing for goal) or with- holds the ball from play by ceasing to attempt to score or advance the ball to a scoring po- sition. When necessary to protect an injured player, the official may immediately stop play. ART. 3 . . . Grants and signals a player's/head coach's oral or visual request for a time-out, such request being granted only when: a. The ball is at the disposal or in control of a player of the same team. b. The ball is dead, unless replacement of a disqualified, or injured player(s), or a player directed to leave the game is pending, and a substitute(s) is available and required. ART. 4 . . . Responds to the scorer's signal to grant a coach's request that a correctable error, as in Rule 2-10, or a timing, scoring or alternating-possession mistake be prevented or rectified. The appeal to the official shall be presented at the scorer's table where a coach of each team may be present.

Page 49 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules SECTION 9 RE-STARTING THE CLOCK ART. 1 . . . After time has been out, the clock shall be started when the official signals the clock to start. If the official neglects to signal, the timer is authorized to start the clock as per rule, unless an official specifically signals continued time-out. ART. 2 . . . If play is started or resumed by a jump ball, the clock shall be started when the tossed ball is legally touched. ART. 3 . . . If a free throw is not successful and the ball is to remain live, the clock shall be started when the ball touches or is touched by a player on the court. ART. 4 . . . If play is resumed by a throw-in, the clock shall be started when the ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court after it is released by the thrower. SECTION 10 TIMING MISTAKES ART. 1 . . . The referee may correct an obvious mistake by the timer to start or stop the clock properly only when the referee has definite information relative to the time involved. The exact time observed by the official may be placed on the clock. ART. 2 . . . If the referee determines the clock malfunctioned or was not started/ stopped properly, or if the clock did not run, an official's count or other official information may be used to make a correction. SECTION 11 CHARGED TIME-OUTS ART. 1 . . . Three 60-second and two 30-second time-outs may be charged to each team during a regulation game. Each team is entitled to one additional 60-second time-out during each extra period. Unused time-outs accumulate and may be used at any time. NOTE: State associations may determine the number of electronic media time-outs for games which are transmitted and may reduce the number of charged time-outs. ART. 2 . . . A single 60-second time-out charged to a team shall not exceed one minute and shall be conducted within the confines of the time-out area. A warn- ing signal for the teams to prepare to resume play is sounded with 15 seconds remaining. Such a time-out shall not be reduced in length unless both teams are ready to play before the time-out is over. ART. 3 . . . A single 30-second charged time-out shall not exceed 30 seconds and players shall remain standing within the time-out area. A warning signal for teams to prepare to resume play is sounded with 15 seconds remaining. No on- court entertainment shall occur during this time. ART. 4 . . . Only one 60-second time-out is charged (or one 30-second time- out, if that is the only type of time-out remaining) in Rule 5-8-4 regardless of the amount of time consumed when no correction is made. EXCEPTION: No time-out is charged: a. If, in Rule 5-8-3, the player's request results from displaced eyeglasses or lens. b. If, in Rule 5-8-4, the error or mistake is prevented or rectified. Rule 5-9

Rule 6-1 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 50 ART. 5 . . . A time-out shall not be granted until after the ball has become live to start the game. The additional 60-second time-out provided for each extra period(s) shall not be granted until after the ball has become live to start the extra period(s). ART. 6 . . . Time-outs in excess of the allotted number may be requested and shall be granted during regulation playing time or any extra period at the expense of a technical foul for each, as in Rule 10-2-3. ART. 7 . . . Successive time-outs, as in Rule 4-43-2, shall not be granted after the expiration of playing time for the fourth quarter or any extra period. In all other instances, they shall be administered in the order in which they were requested. ART. 8 . . . Time-outs simultaneously requested by opposing teams or those requested to keep players in the game that were directed to leave for injury/blood, as in Rules 3-3-6 and 3-3-7 NOTES, shall be granted, charged to the respective team and administered concurrently. When one team is charged with a 30-second time-out and the other a 60-second time-out, the duration shall be 60 seconds. r Rule 6 Live Ball and Dead Ball SECTION 1 LIVE BALL ART. 1 . . . The game and each extra period shall be started by a jump ball in the center restraining circle. After any subsequent dead ball, the only way to get the ball live is to resume play by a jump ball in the center restraining circle, by a throw-in or by a free throw. The dribble and traveling rules are not in effect in these situations. ART. 2 . . . The ball becomes live when: a. On a jump ball, the tossed ball leaves the official's hand(s). b. On a throw-in, it is at the disposal of the thrower. c. On a free throw, it is at the disposal of the free thrower. NOTE: Any rules statement is made on the assumption that no infraction is involved unless mentioned or implied. If such infraction occurs, the rule governing it is followed. For example, a game or extra period will not start with a jump ball if a foul occurs before the ball becomes live. SECTION 2 STARTING GAME/QUARTER/EXTRA PERIOD ART. 1 . . . The game, quarter and each extra period begins when the ball becomes live as specified in Rule 6-1-2 for a jump ball, throw-in or free throw. ART. 2 . . . To start the game and each extra period, the ball shall be put in play in the center restraining circle by a jump ball between any two opponents. ART. 3 . . . To start the second, third and fourth quarters, the ball shall be put in play by a throw-in under the alternating-possession procedure.

Page 51 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules SECTION 3 JUMP-BALL ADMINISTRATION ART. 1 . . . For any jump ball, each jumper shall have both feet within that half of the center restraining circle which is farther from the jumper's basket. ART. 2 . . . When the official is ready and until the ball is tossed, nonjumpers shall not: a. Move onto the center restraining circle. b. Change position around the center restraining circle. ART. 3 . . . Teammates may not occupy adjacent positions around the center restraining circle if an opponent indicates a desire for one of these positions be- fore the official is ready to toss the ball. ART. 4 . . . The ball shall be tossed upward between the jumpers in a plane at right angles to the sidelines. The toss shall be to a height greater than either of them can jump so that it will drop between them. ART. 5 . . . Until the tossed ball is touched by one or both jumpers, nonjumpers shall not: a. Have either foot break the plane of the center restraining circle cylinder. b. Take a position in any occupied space. ART. 6 . . . The tossed ball shall be touched by one or both of the jumpers after it reaches its highest point. If the ball contacts the floor without being touched by at least one of the jumpers, the official shall toss it again. ART. 7 . . . Neither jumper shall: a. Touch the tossed ball before it reaches its highest point. b. Leave the center restraining circle until the ball has been touched. c. Catch the ball before the jump ball ends. d. Touch the ball more than twice. ART. 8 . . . The jump ball and the restrictions in Rule 6-3-7 end when the touched ball contacts one of the eight nonjumpers, an official or the floor. NOTE: During a jump ball, a jumper is not required to face the jumper's own basket, provided the jumper is in the proper half of the center restraining circle. The jumper is also not required to jump and attempt to touch the tossed ball. However, if neither jumper touches the ball it should be tossed again with both jumpers being ordered to jump and try to touch the ball. SECTION 4 ALTERNATING POSSESSION ART. 1 . . . Other than the start of the game and each extra period, the teams will alternate taking the ball out of bounds for a throw-in. The team obtaining control from the jump ball establishes the alternating-possession procedure, and the arrow is set toward the opponent's basket. Control may also be established by the results of a violation or foul, as in Rule 4-3. ART. 2 . . . To start the second, third and fourth quarters, the throw-in shall be from out of bounds at the division line opposite the scorer's and timer's table. Rule 6-3

Rule 6-5 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules ART. 3 . . . Alternating-possession throw-ins shall be from: a. One of the four designated spots nearest to where the ball was located if possession is retained or gained in the team's frontcourt. (Diagram 5) b. The out-of-bounds spot nearest to where the ball was located if possession is retained or gained in the team's backcourt. ART. 4 . . . An alternating-possession throw-in shall result when: a. A held ball occurs. b. The ball goes out of bounds, as in Rule 7-3. c. Simultaneous floor or free-throw violations occur. d. A live ball lodges between the backboard and ring or comes to rest on the flange, unless a free throw or throw-in follows. e. Opponents commit simultaneous basket-interference violations. f. The point of interruption cannot be determined as in Rule 4-36-2c. NOTE: When the alternating-possession procedure has not been established, the jump ball shall be in the center restraining circle between the two players involved in the pre- vious action. ART. 5 . . . The direction of the possession arrow is reversed immediately af- ter an alternating-possession throw-in ends. An alternating-possession throw-in ends when the throw-in ends, as in Rule 4-42-5. ART. 6 . . . The opportunity to make an alternating-possession throw-in is lost if the throw-in team violates. If either team fouls during an alternating-possession throw-in, it does not cause the throw-in team to lose the possession arrow. If the defensive team commits a violation during the throw-in, the possession arrow is not switched. SECTION 5 BALL IN PLAY BY THROW-IN The ball shall be put in play by a throw-in under circumstances as outlined in Rules 6-4-1, 6-4-2, 6-4-4; Rules 7-1 through 7-6; Rule 8-5; and Rules 9-1 through 9-13. SECTION 6 BALL IN PLAY BY FREE THROW The ball shall be put in play by placing it at the disposal of the free thrower before each free throw.

2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 74 SHOT CLOCK – STATE ASSOCIATION ADOPTION In accordance with Rule 2-14, each state association may adopt a procedure by which it implements a 35-second shot clock effective with the 2023-24 season. The following rec- ommended guidelines are for those states choosing to adopt the shot clock. SHOT CLOCK DISPLAYS 1. A shot clock is one of two official visible timepieces – one at each end of the court. 2. Shot clocks should be recessed and mounted on the backboard supports be- hind each backboard. 3. An alternate -timing device or procedure shall be available when a visible shot clock malfunctions. 4. LED lights located around the shot clock may be used, but the lights shall only be activated for a shot clock violation. 5. Nothing shall be attached to the shot clock mounting mechanisms that affects the visibility of the shot clock. GAME AND TABLE OFFICIALS A shot clock operator will be located at the scorer’s and timer’s table. It is recommended that the timer and shot clock operator be seated next to each other. OFFICIALS' GENERAL DUTIES 1. Use the shot clock to administer the 10-second backcourt count (9-8). The 10-second count shall begin when the ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court, in the backcourt on a throw-in or on player control on a rebound or jump ball. The official shall use a silent, visible 10-second count when there is no shot clock visible. 2. To indicate a shot clock violation, the official will give the stop clock signal followed by the tapping of the head and give a direction- al signal. 3. To indicate a shot clock reset, the official will use a rolling motion of a pointed index finger above the head. THE SHOT CLOCK OPERATOR SHALL: 1. Use a 35-second shot clock in accordance with Rule 2-14. 2. Use the shot clock the entire game, including extra periods, except when there is less time remaining on the game clock than on the shot clock. In this case, the shot clock shall be turned off. 3. Control a separate timing device with a horn that shall have a distinct sound different from the game clock horn. 4. Have an alternate-timing device or procedure available in the case of failure or lack of availability of the electronic clocks.

Page 75 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules 5. Start the shot clock when: a. The ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court; b. A team gains initial control after a jump ball or unsuccessful try for goal; c. There is a change in team control. 6. Stop the timing device and reset to full amount: a. When there is a change in team control and the ball remains live or after a score by the opponent. NOTE: The mere touching of the ball by an opponent does not start a new shot clock period when the same team remains in control of the ball. b. When any of the following occurs: i. A single personal foul; ii. A single technical foul; iii. During team control, a defensive player causes a held ball, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the defensive team; iv. A try for goal strikes the ring or flange and then control is gained by either team; v. A violation; vi. A held ball or any other situation where the alternating-possession ar- row is used to determine team possession and the alternating-posses- sion arrow favors the defense for the throw-in. vii. After the ball goes out of bounds and was last touched simultaneously by two opponents, both of whom are either inbounds or out of bounds or when there is doubt as to who last touched the ball and the posses- sion arrow favors the defensive team; viii. There is an inadvertent whistle and there was no player or team control at the time of the whistle; 7. Stop the timing device and continue time without a reset when play is stopped under the following circumstances: a. The ball is deflected out of bounds by a defensive player; b. A player is injured or loses a contact lens; c. A charged time-out has concluded; d. During team control as defined in Rule 4-12-1, a defensive player causes a held ball, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the offensive team; e. After any double personal or technical fouls or simultaneous personal or tech- nical fouls when there is team control unless the penalty for the foul results in a change of possession; f. After an inadvertent whistle when there is team control; g. After a held ball occurs during a throw-in, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the team that made the throw-in; h. When a held ball occurs after an unsuccessful try that does not contact the ring or flange, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the shooting team; i. After the ball goes out of bounds and was last touched simultaneously by two opponents, both of whom are either inbounds or out of bounds or when there is doubt as to who last touched the ball and the alternating-possession arrow favors the offensive team; NOTE: The offensive team, upon regaining possession of the ball for the throw- in, shall have the unexpired time on the shot clock to attempt a try.

Page 76 8. State associations may determine if there are instances when the clock is reset, not to the full 35 seconds. 9. Sound the shot clock horn at the expiration of the shot clock period. This shot clock horn shall not stop play unless recognized by an official’s whistle. When the shot clock indicates zeroes, the shot clock time has expired. 10. Turn off the shot clock when a reset situation occurs, and the game clock shows less time than that of a shot clock period. 11. Allow the timing device to continue during loose-ball situations when the offense retains control or when a field goal try is attempted at the wrong basket or when a field goal try has failed to hit the rim or flange. 12. Allow the game officials to make the final decision when there is doubt as to whether a score was made within the shot clock period or whether a try for goal contacted the ring or flange. TIMING ERRORS 1. The officials shall make the final decision when there is doubt as to whether a score was made within the shot clock period or whether a try for goal contacted the ring or flange. 2. When an obvious mistake by the shot clock operator has occurred (failing to start, stop, set or reset the shot clock) or when a shot clock has malfunctioned, the mistake or the result of the malfunction may be corrected during the shot clock period in which it occurred and only when the official has definite informa- tion relative to the mistake or malfunction and the time involved. 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules SHOT CLOCK VIOLATION 1. A shot clock period begins when the ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court on a throw-in or when team control is established or re-es- tablished after loss of team control and the shot clock is properly started. The shot clock period ends when the shot clock is properly started for the next shot clock period. 2. A try for goal during the shot clock period is defined as the ball having left the shooter’s hand(s) before the sounding of the shot clock horn and then striking the ring or flange, or entering the basket. 3. The team in control must attempt a try for a field goal within the 35-second shot clock period. 4. It is a violation when a try for field goal does not leave the shooter’s hand(s) before the expiration of the shot clock period (as indicated by the sounding of the shot clock horn) or when it does leave the shooter’s hand(s) before the expiration of the shot clock period and the try does not subsequently strike the ring or flange or enter the basket.

Page 77 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules COMMENTS ON THE 2023-24 RULES CHANGES 2-1-3 NOTE (NEW) — As a result of the increased use of large video boards that allow timers to utilize tablets to control the clock from anywhere in the facility and the increase in schools utilizing the shot clock, it became necessary to include language requiring the shot clock operator, if used, to sit at the scorer’s and timer’s table. Officials need to have easy access to the scorer, timer and the shot clock operator during contests. 3-4-5 — Clarifying the requirements for uniform bottoms makes it easier for coaches and athletic directors to address the individual needs of their student-athletes when ordering uniforms. Teammates must all wear like-colored uniform bottoms but may wear multiple styles. This clarification allows for an athlete to wear a skirt or pants of the same color as the athlete’s teammates without contacting the state association for a uniform accommodation. 3-5-6 — Allowing undershirts worn under visiting team jerseys to be black or the single solid color similar to the torso of the jersey will assist schools with hard to match colors easily comply with the rules. Schools can now allow teammates to wear black undershirts and avoid searching for solid shirts that match the visiting team jersey. It is important to note that all teammates wearing undershirts must wear the same solid color. 4-8-1 — Eliminating the one-and-one, shooting two free throws after a team’s fifth foul in a quarter and resetting the fouls after each quarter has the potential to provide a better flow by allowing teams that run into early foul trouble the opportunity to self-correct their style of play at the outset of both the second and fourth quarters. Second, by eliminating the one-and-one, the number of opportunities for correctable errors that result from awarding an unmerited free throw or failing to award a merited free throw are significantly reduced. Finally, the guarantee of two free throws eliminates the physical play that has often been associated with rebounding action on the first free throw. 4-36, 6-4-3, 7-5-2 thru 4, 9-1 PENALTY 3, 9-4 PENALTY, 9-5 PENALTY, 9-6 PENALTY, 9-8 PENALTY, 9-9 PENALTY, 9-12 PENALTIES 3 & 4, 9-13 PENALTY — Establishing four throw-in spots (the nearest 28-foot mark along each sideline or the nearest spot 3-feet out- side the lane line on the end line) when a team gains or retains possession in its frontcourt due to a violation, a common foul prior to the bonus or any stoppage other than an out-of- bounds eliminates much of the judgment for an official about where exactly the throw-in spot should be located and allows teams to develop throw-in plays both offensively and defensively from four pre-determined locations. 7-6-6 — Allowing the official administering a throw-in to the wrong team to correct the mistake before the first dead ball after the ball becomes live unless there is a change of possession provides an appropriate amount of time to correct a mistake. Previously, the mistake had to be corrected before the ball was put into play. 9-3-3 — Establishing that a player may step out of bounds without penalty unless they are the first player to touch the ball after returning to the court or if they left the court to avoid a violation allows the game to continue without stoppage when the player’s actions did not create an advantage. When an advantage is gained by a player purposely leaving the court and being the first one to touch the ball or leaving the court to avoid a violation, an advantage is gained, and a violation has occurred.

2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules BASKETBALL RULES FUNDAMENTALS Page 81 1. While the ball remains live, a loose ball always remains in control of the team whose player last had control, unless it is a try or tap for goal. 2. Neither a team nor any player is ever in control during a dead ball, jump ball, or when the ball is in flight during a try or tap for a goal. 3. A goal is made when a live ball enters the basket from above and remains in or passes through unless canceled by a throw-in violation or a player-control foul. 4. The jump ball, the throw-in and the free throw are the only methods of getting a dead ball live. 5. Neither the dribble nor traveling rule applies during the jump ball, throw-in or free throw. 6. It is not possible for a player to travel during a dribble. 7. The only infractions for which points are awarded are goaltending by the defense or basket interference at the opponent's basket. 8. There are three types of violations and each has its own penalty. 9. A ball in flight has the same relationship to frontcourt or backcourt, or inbounds or out of bounds, as when it last touched a person or the floor. 10. Personal fouls always involve illegal contact and occur during a live ball, except for fouls committed by an airborne shooter or on an airborne shooter. 11. The penalty for a single flagrant personal or flagrant technical foul is two free throws and disqualification, plus awarding the ball to the opponents for a throw-in. 12. Penalties for fouls are administered in the order in which they occur. 13. A live-ball foul by the offense (team in control or last in control if the ball is loose), or the expiration of time for a quarter or extra period, causes the ball to become dead immediately, unless the ball is in flight during a try or tap for field goal. The ball also becomes dead when a player-control foul occurs. 14. The first or only free-throw violation by the offense causes the ball to become dead immediately. 15. A double personal foul involves only personal fouls and only two opponents; no free throws are awarded and the ball is put in play at the point of interruption. A double technical foul involves only technical fouls and only two opponents; no free throws are awarded, and the ball is put in play at the point of interruption. 16. The official's whistle seldom causes the ball to become dead (it is already dead). 17. "Continuous motion" applies both to tries and taps for field goals and free throws, but it has no significance unless there is a foul by the defense during the interval which begins when the habitual trying or tapping movement starts and ends when the ball is clearly in flight. 18. Whether the clock is running or is stopped has no influence on the counting of a field goal. 19. A ball which touches the front face or edges of the backboard is treated the same as touching the floor inbounds, except that when the ball touches the thrower's back- board, it does not constitute a part of a dribble. 20. If the ball goes through the basket before or after a player-control foul, the goal shall not be counted.

Appendix A 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 82 APPENDIX A DUTIES OF GAME MANAGEMENT I. Relationship of Game Management to Officials: A. General: Most individuals officiate because it is an avocation that provides the opportunity to main- tain contact with the game and with those who administer the contests. If responsible and highly respected people are to be kept in the field, they should be accorded the cordial and businesslike treatment they expect in professions and other vocations. They are requested to render decisions in rather technical matters and in an atmosphere charged with prejudice and emotion. No effort should be spared in providing conditions that will be conducive to efficiency and pleasant associ- ations. Each contest administrator owes this to the official who is a guest and to the school that must depend on the work being of such a nature as to attract people who are in the habit of being treated with respect. B. Reminders: 1. Notify the officials at least one week before each game giving the exact time and place of the game and the location of the officials' dressing room. 2. Inform each official who they will be working with. Perhaps a ride can be shared. 3. Secure the visiting-school's approval of the officials, if appropriate, several weeks before the game and confirm the approval as soon as possible. 4. If parking facilities are a problem, provide a place for the officials. 5. Designate an official's host. The host should meet them at the door, escort them to the dress- ing room(s) and see that they are provided with towels and soap. The host may also accompa- ny the officials to the floor and take care of their jackets and be responsible for the game ball between halves. The host management should provide personnel to wipe moisture from the floor, clean up blood and maintain proper floor conditions as requested by the officials. 6. Provide a clean, private dressing room with shower or nearby shower stall. Before and after a game, and at halftime, the officials room(s) should be "out of bounds" for everyone except the few who have a definite assignment in this area. Insist that coaches instruct their players to be courteous and respectful to all officials. A time- out should be requested if questions are to be directed to the officials, and the privilege of asking questions should be delegated to the captain only. Questions should be limited to those dealing with rules interpretation or game procedure. Nothing is ever gained by questioning an official's judgment, and it may lead to a penalty. A public expression of dissent from an official's judgment decision merely excites the fans and often results in a penalty. 8. Keep your crowd under control. A continuing program of education and training will work wonders. Police protection should be available and in evidence. 9. Do not permit any type of artificial noisemakers. Bands and other music may only be played during pregame, time-outs, intermission and post-game. 10. Insist that coaches set good examples for your crowd and players. Properly use the optional coaching box. Do not shout at players or officials. The coach, more than any other person, sets the pattern for the attitude of the fans. 11. Do not permit coaches to argue or visit with the official during a game or during an inter- mission. Criticizing an official in front of fans or players invites trouble. Avoid the officials' dressing room(s) unless, just before their departure, you wish to visit briefly. If you have a grievance, stay away. Communicate with officials after two or three days have passed and emotions have settled. 12. You either hired or approved the officials. Take your share of the blame if you are not pleased. The chances are about 100 to 1 – or less that your team lost the game because of the officiating. 13. Emotions need to be controlled. Basketball calls for coaches and players who have poise and coolness under fire. Team directors must demonstrate the same qualities. 7.

Facility Conditions: Gymnasium conditions have a great influence in administration of a game. A slippery floor or one with a layer of accumulated dust is a source of trouble and dissatisfaction. An inadequately lighted court detracts from efficiency and has a depressing effect on everyone. Unclean backboards, basket rings that are not level or basket nets that are either ragged or tight so as to cause delays, are conditions that contribute to an unsatisfactory event. For many school patrons, the athletic contest provides the only opportunity for seeing the school in action. Their impression ought to be one of good organization and businesslike efficiency. D. Time Management: Starting a game later than scheduled and having unduly long athletic contests are evidence of a lack of administrative responsibility. They are an imposition on the visiting team, the students, the fans and the officials. E. Choosing Personnel: Properly administering a contest is an exacting task. Many coworkers are involved. Each member of this team of student managers and faculty assistants has delegated responsibilities. It is important to conduct practice for this team in the fundamentals of good man- agement. A team that demonstrates pride in its work will provide fewer "athletic headaches" because the school provides conditions that keep players and followers looking for enjoyable occurrences and clear of passing judgment on decisions and playing strategy. II. Selection of Scorer and Timer: A. Adults: A high school student or one of last year's graduates will have the interest and enthusiasm but may lack poise, impartiality and judgment. B. Experience: Choose someone who has had some playing, coaching or officiating experience. C. Faculty: If faculty members are available for these jobs, they usually do the best work, although it is not a guarantee. D. Reliable: Choose people who can and will be present at every home game. It may be an honor to act as timer or scorer, but it's not an honor that should be passed around with each game. E. Good Judgment: Above all, choose someone with plenty of poise, good judgment, a sense of impar- tiality and one who you are sure will be able to forget the score and concentrate instead on the job. III. Training the Table Officials: A. Preseason: Before the opening of the season, provide the table officials with a rules book, case book and other basketball rules material available through the state office. This should be done regardless of the number of years they have served in this capacity. There are frequent rules changes that affect the tasks of these officials. Call attention to those sections of the rules that directly or indirectly refer to their duties. Insist on a careful study of the "Instructions to the Scorer" and "Instructions to the Timer." B. Rules Meetings: Suggest that your timer and scorer attend one of the state-sponsored rules inter- pretation meetings and, if possible, an occasional meeting of a local officials' group. C. Practice Games: Before the first game, arrange for several intrasquad scrimmages conducted under actual game conditions with your timer and scorer at the bench. Plan to set up unusual situations involving timing and scoring. Check carefully on the work done in these scrimmages and make comments and provide constructive feedback. D. Observe and Evaluate: Observe the work of these officials during games and provide suggestions for improvement. E. Crew Respect: See that your timer and scorer are accorded the same courtesy and respect as that due the floor officials. Their work is important, and it should be done with dignity and pride in good performance. Page 83 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Appendix A C.

Page 86 National Federation of State High School Associations EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES 1. Each NFHS sports rules committee is responsible for recommending the official playing rules to the NFHS Board of Directors for adoption. The committee is NOT responsible for testing or approving playing equipment for use in interscholastic sports. Equipment manufacturers are responsible for the development of playing equipment that meets the specifications established by the committee, and that is otherwise of good design and quality. The NFHS urges manufacturers to work with the various independent testing agencies to ensure the production of safe products. Neither the NFHS nor the applicable NFHS sport rules committee certifies the safety of any sport equipment. Non-compliant equipment is inappropriate for use in competition under NFHS sports rules. While the committee does not regulate the development of new equipment and does not set technical or scientific standards for testing equipment, the committee may, from time to time, provide manufacturers with guidance as to the equipment-performance levels it considers consistent with the integrity of the game. The committee reserves the right to intercede to protect and maintain that integrity. 2. Each NFHS sport rules committee suggests that manufacturers planning innovative changes in sports equipment submit the equipment to the applicable NFHS sport rules editor and/or rules committee for review before production. 3. Protective headgear is required by NFHS rules in some sports and is permissive in others. Hard helmets can decrease the incidence of certain head trauma, such as skull fractures and subdural hematomas. Soft headgear may protect against cuts and bruises to the scalp and forehead. Coaches, athletes and parents/guardians should review the manufacturers’ warnings about proper usage and performance limits of such products. No helmet or headgear can eliminate the risk of concussion and all sports should be played, coached and officiated in recognition of that fact.

Page 87 2023-2 4 NFHS Basketball Rules Appendix E National Federation of State High School Associations GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SPORTS HYGIENE, SKIN INFECTIONS AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Proper precautions are needed to minimize the potential risk of the spread of communicable disease and skin infections during athletic competition. These conditions include skin infections that occur due to skin contact with competitors and equipment. The transmission of infections such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Herpes Gladiatorum, blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B, and other infectious diseases such as Influenza and COVID-19 can often be greatly reduced through proper hygiene. The NFHS SMAC has outlined and listed below some general guidelines for the prevention of the spread of these diseases. UNIVERSAL HYGIENE PROTOCOL FOR ALL SPORTS: BLOOD-BORNE INFECTIOUS DISEASES • Shower immediately after every competition and practice, Strategies for reducing the potential exposure to these agents using liquid soap and not a shared bar soap; include following Universal Precautions such as: • Wash all workout clothing after each practice, washing in • A student who is bleeding, has an open wound, has any hot water and drying on a high heat setting; amount of blood on a uniform, or has blood on their body, • Clean and/or wash all personal gear (knee pads, head gear, shall be directed to leave the activity (game or practice) braces, etc.) and gym bags at least weekly; until the bleeding is stopped, the wound is covered, the • Do not share towels or personal hygiene products (razors) uniform and/or body is appropriately cleaned, and/or the with others; uniform is changed before returning to activity; • Refrain from full body and/or cosmetic shaving of head, • Athletic trainers or other caregivers must wear gloves chest, arms, legs, abdomen, and groin; and use Universal Precautions to prevent blood or body • Students should clean hands with an alcohol-based gel or fluid-splash from contaminating themselves or others; soap and water before and after every practice and contest • In the event of a blood or body fluid-splash, immediately to decrease bacterial load on the hands; wash contaminated skin or mucous membranes with soap • Covering up coughs and sneezes in the bend of the elbow and water.

Appendix F 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules Page 88 National Federation of State High School Associations COACHES CODE OF ETHICS The function of a coach is to educate students through participation in interscholastic competition. An interscholastic program should be designed to enhance academic achievement and should never interfere with opportunities for academic success. Each student should be treated with the utmost respect and the student’s welfare should be considered in decisions by the coach at all times. Accordingly, the following guidelines for coaches have been adopted by the NFHS Board of Directors: • Coaches shall be aware that they have a tremendous influence, for either good or ill, on the education of the student and, thus, shall never place the value of winning above the value of instilling the highest ideals of character. • Coaches shall uphold the honor and dignity of the profession. In all personal contact with students, officials, athletic directors, school administrators and staff, the state high school athletic association, the media, parents, and the public, coaches shall strive to set an example of the highest ethical and moral conduct. Communication with all parties should be wholesome, appropriate and positive. • Coaches shall respect and support contest officials. Coaches shall not indulge in conduct which would incite players or spectators against the officials. Public criticism of officials or players is unethical and inappropriate. • Coaches shall take an active role in the prevention of drug, alcohol, tobacco and other substance abuse. • Coaches shall avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco products when in contact with players. • Coaches shall promote the entire interscholastic program of the school and direct the program in harmony with the total school program. • Coaches shall master the contest rules and shall teach the rules to their team members. • Coaches shall not seek an advantage by circumvention of the spirit or letter of the rules. • Coaches shall utilize their positive influence to enhance sportsmanship by spectators, both directly and by working closely with cheerleaders, other school club sponsors, booster clubs and administrators. • Coaches shall promote a culture that encourages diversity and inclusion. • Coaches shall ensure they familiarize themselves and their teams with their schools’ emergency action plans and, where applicable, with concussion and heat illness prevention plans. • Coaches should meet and exchange cordial greetings with the opposing coach to set the positive example and correct tone for the event before and after the contest. • Coaches shall not exert pressure on faculty members to give students special consideration. • Coaches shall not scout opponents by any means other than those adopted by the league and/or state high school association.

National Federation of State High School Associations OFFICIALS CODE OF ETHICS Officials at an interscholastic athletic event are participants in the educational development of high school students. As such, they must exercise a high level of self-discipline, independence and responsibility. The purpose of this Code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all interscholastic officials. • Officials shall master both the rules of the game and the mechanics necessary to enforce the rules, and shall exercise authority in an impartial, firm and controlled manner. • Officials shall work with each other and their state associations in a constructive and cooperative manner. • Officials shall uphold the honor and dignity of the profession in all interaction with student-athletes, coaches, athletic directors, school administrators, colleagues, and the public. This includes, but is not limited to, positive verbal and nonverbal communication with coaches, bench personnel and players. • Officials shall avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco products beginning with the arrival at the competition site until departure following the completion of the contest. • Officials shall prepare themselves both physically and mentally, shall dress neatly and appropriately, and shall comport themselves in a manner consistent with the high standards of the profession. • Officials shall be punctual and professional in the fulfillment of all contractual obligations. • Officials shall remain mindful that their conduct influences the respect that student-athletes, coaches and the public hold for the profession. • Officials shall, while enforcing the rules of play, remain aware of the inherent risk of injury that competition poses to student-athletes. Where appropriate, officials shall inform event manage- ment of conditions or situations that appear unreasonably hazardous. • Officials shall take reasonable steps to educate themselves in the recognition of emergency conditions that might arise during the course of competition. • Officials shall maintain an ethical approach while participating in forums, chat rooms and all forms of social media.

Appendix H Page 90 National Federation of State High School Associations MODIFICATIONS FOR COMPETITION BELOW NINTH GRADE Interscholastic competition at the middle school/junior high level can make valuable contribu- tions to educational programming, provided the sport is properly organized, supervised and regulated. Students in this particular age group have unique physical, psychological, emotional and developmental needs. In order to minimize risk of injury, it may be necessary to modify regulations to offer meaningful competition for different groups. These recommended modifications are for middle school/junior high competition. State asso- ciations may adopt additional modifications and/or use other rules codes for middle school/ junior high competition. SIZE OF THE COURT: The field of play shall be rectangular and is recommended to be no larger than 84 by 50 feet for middle level/junior high school competition. BALL SIZE: Either the 29½ or 28½ inch ball may be legally used for boys’ middle school competition. LENGTH OF PERIODS OF PLAY Games involving only students below the ninth grade shall be played in six-minute quarters with intermissions of one minute after the first and third quarters, and 10 minutes between halves. Playing time and number of quarters for non-varsity game quarters may be reduced by mutual agreement of opposing coaches. 2023-24 NFHS Basketball Rules
