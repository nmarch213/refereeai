2024-25 NFHS VOLLEYBALL RULES BOOK Dr. KARISSA L. NIEHOFF, Publisher Lindsey Atkinson, Editor NFHS Publications To maintain the sound traditions of this sport, encourage sportsmanship and mini- mize the inherent risk of injury, the National Federation of State High School Associa- tions (NFHS) writes playing rules for varsity competition among student-athletes of high school age. High school coaches, officials and administrators who have knowledge and experience regarding this particular sport and age group volunteer their time to serve on the rules committee. Member associations of the NFHS independently make decisions regarding compliance with or modification of these playing rules for the student-athletes in their respective states. NFHS rules are used by education-based and non-education-based organizations serving children of varying skill levels who are of high school age and younger. In order to make NFHS rules skill-level and age-level appropriate, the rules may be modified by any organization that chooses to use them. Except as may be specifically noted in this rules book, the NFHS makes no recommendation about the nature or extent of the modifications that may be appropriate for children who are younger or less skilled than high school varsity athletes. Every individual using these rules is responsible for prudent judgment with respect to each contest, athlete and facility, and each athlete is responsible for exercising caution and good sportsmanship. These rules should be interpreted and applied so as to make reasonable accommodations for athletes, coaches and officials with disabilities. © 2024, By the National Federation of State High School Associations.

Under all circumstances, on- site event management should utilize set-ups that minimize risk. If a given facility can- not be made reasonably hazard-free, the event should be relocated.

2024-25 Volleyball Rules Changes (For comments on the 2024-25 rules changes, see page 55) 4-2-3 NOTE (NEW), 7-1-1 NOTE — Adds language regarding the proper pro- cedure for a legal uniform number change and expands to include a damaged unform as a legal reason for changing a uniform number. 5-4-3c(1) — Allows all players on the roster, not just starting players, to stand on their respective end lines prior to the first set, encouraging the inclusion of all players in the prematch announcements. 5-9-2b NOTE (NEW), State Association Adoption Chart — Requires line judg- es to switch sides of the court between sets to promote fairness when, by state association adoption, teams remain on the same benches throughout the match. 11-4-1b — Permits a team to immediately substitute for the libero replacement, who may be playing out of position, during an injury time-out if the libero is in- jured or ill and cannot continue. 2024-25 Volleyball Major Editorial Changes Suggested Prematch Protocol (NEW) — Provides guidance for establishing standardized prematch protocols as well as timed warm-ups. 2024-25 Volleyball Editorial Changes 4-1-7a,b; 5-4-3c(3 thru 24); 9-5-1a(2); 9-5-1a(4); 9-5-1b(1); 9-5-1b(4); 9-5-6b; 12 NOTES 1 Each state high school association adopting these rules is the sole and exclusive source of binding rules interpretations for contests involving its member schools. Any person having questions about the interpretation of NFHS rules should contact the rules interpreter designated by the respective state high school association. The NFHS is the sole and exclusive source of model interpretations of NFHS rules. State rules interpreters may contact the NFHS for model rules interpretations. No other model rules interpretations should be considered.

2024-25 Points of Emphasis Ball Handling Volleyball is a rebound sport and players are able to use any body part to play the ball. The official’s judgment on the legality of each contact continues to be a controversial topic. The goal for players is to master ball control; for officials, it is a goal to maintain a consistent level of ball handling from set to set and from match to match. Coaches play a role in the consistency equation with their methods of training, the expectations placed on their play- ers, and the desired level of allowance by the officials. The spectators are influenced by their coaches’ reactions, the spin of the ball, and their personal opinions, while the officials need to remain neutral to maintain fairness for both teams. It was stated in a previous NFHS Volleyball Points of Emphasis that volleyball’s goal was to increase the continuation of play when judging second ball contacts that are directed to a teammate. A player in a good position must play the ball without discernible double contact. Less severe judgment is applied to a contact by a player who makes a challenging or spec- tacular play while maintaining a legal play. Mishandled balls resulting in a blatant fault should still be called, regardless of the chal- lenging or spectacular nature of the play. Multiple contacts on the third ball must be whistled. With the increase of the players’ athleticism, officials are being challenged to judge the legality of the first contact, as well. The rule states that the ball is not allowed to come to rest or involve prolonged contact. The fact that the contact is an underhand action or done with an open hand is not an automatic call. Players are able to legally take a stab at the ball in an attempt to keep the ball alive as they pursue an errant contact from their teammate. A whistle should accompany prolonged contact. All skills should be judged similarly, according to the rules. Players are utilizing the setter dump effectively, while attackers are tipping the ball deeper into their opponent’s court and tipping with more power. Officials must determine where the ball contact was initiated in relation to the body and judge how long the player continued the action while in contact with the ball. Scoring Best Practices The score crew is an integral part of the officiating team. To facilitate a smooth match tempo, the scorer should: • Arrive at the site no less than 20 minutes before match time. • Complete the match information in the scorebook/scoresheet or an electronic scoring device. • Accept the team rosters and team lineups. • Record each team’s lineup in a scorebook/scoresheet or an electronic scoring device. • Secure each team’s lineup sheet by placing them face down on the score table. • Collaborate with the second referee to ensure that each team’s lineup is correct on the second referee's lineup card and verify that the teams are in correct starting positions on the court prior to each set. • The scorer should establish a routine with the assistant scorer who serves as a spotter and communicates the numbers of the incoming/outgoing substitutions and replacements. • The assistant scorer tracks each libero replacement and each substitution. • After the substitution information has been submitted, the scorer should indicate read- iness to the second referee.

• For written scoring, alternate each full rotation/round of service (all six positions from each team have served) in a contrasting color of ink. • If there are any scoring issues, notify the second referee. • Communicate with the second referee during time-outs and between sets. Host Management Best Practices Host management plays an important role in creating a positive, fun and safe environ- ment for the players, coaches, officials and spectators. The designated administrator on site should introduce themselves to the officials upon arrival at the facility and show them to their locker room(s). The same should be done for visiting teams as they arrive on site. Officials and coaches should be able to identify host management easily if a situation should arise. In addition to being present, host management should: • Ensure that the facility is set up properly one hour before the match. • Ensure that the net system is set up at the correct height and is padded. • Ensure that the referee’s stand is safely secure and padded. • Assist in ensuring teams do not enter the court from both sides and do not encircle the entire court. • Be available throughout the match(es). • Post signage for home/visitor and/or student section. Allow fans to stand, but not on the playing surface. • Ensure that any unsporting conduct (comments intended or designed to embarrass, ridicule or demean others) by spectators is not tolerated. It needs to be immediately addressed. • Collaborate with the officials to suspend play for fan issues, if necessary.

The NFHS rules governing prematch procedures can be found in Rule 1-6. It is recommend- ed that state associations adopt prematch protocols including warm-up procedures similar to the examples provided below. • The competition court should be set up and available at least one hour before the first scheduled match. • A timed warm-up period for each team should be predetermined. The timed warm-up period will vary depending on facility and format of matches. ◦ During shared warm-up, players may not intentionally or cause balls to intentionally enter the opponent’s court. ◦ When one team has exclusive use of the court the other team should be at its’ bench or off the playable area. Teams can utilize an auxiliary gym or the area behind the team bench if adequate space is available. • Announcements – teams on their endlines for player introductions, national anthem, shak- ing hands, etc. Sample Prematch Warm-up for Dual Matches Protocol Court setup by host management and available to teams Officials arrive on court in uniform Assistant officials report to first referee Prematch conference (rosters due) Timed warm-up – shared court Timed warm-up – home team's court Timed warm-up – visiting team's court Lineups due Audio signal to indicate the end of timed warm-ups Announcements (National Anthem, Introductions, etc.) Team huddle Match begins NOTE: Times may be adjusted to accommodate arrival times, facilities, tournaments, etc. It is recom- mended that each team receives a minimum of 4 minutes on the court for hitting and serving.

Rule 1-1 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 10 r Rule 1 The Game SECTION 1 DEFINITION Volleyball is a game played by two teams consisting of six players on a rectan- gular court separated into two areas by a net and using an inflated ball. One team serves the ball over the net, trying to make it land within the opponent's playing area. The receiving team attempts to return the ball over the net in such a manner that it will land within the opponent's playing area. SECTION 2 MATCH ART. 1 . . . A match shall consist of the best three-of-five sets. The first team to win three sets shall be the winner of the match. The fourth and fifth sets shall not be played unless it is necessary to determine the winner of the match. NOTES: 1. By state high school association adoption, teams may play a best two-of-three sets match in which a team is considered the winner of the match when it wins two sets. All sets shall be 25 points (no cap). The third set shall not be played unless it is necessary to determine the winner of the match. If a third set is necessary, a coin toss shall be conducted prior to that set. 2. By state high school association adoption, modification of match format is permitted for series other than dual varsity matches. ART. 2 . . . The interval between sets is a maximum of three minutes unless an intermission for promotional or special recognition activities is used. (11-5-1) Any intermission shall not exceed two minutes. ART. 3 . . . A match shall entitle each team a maximum of two time-outs per set. ART. 4 . . . The serve/receive for set No. 1 is determined by a coin toss conduct- ed during the prematch conference. If a deciding set is required, the serve/receive and playing areas are also determined by a coin toss. a. First set – During the prematch conference, a visiting team captain shall call the toss. The winner shall choose to serve or receive. b. Deciding set – If necessary, prior to the deciding set, a home captain shall call the toss. The winner shall choose to serve/receive or the playing area. The loser of the toss shall be given the remaining choice. SECTION 3 SCORING POINTS ART. 1 . . . When a team commits a fault, the result is a loss of rally and the opponent shall receive a point. ART. 2 . . . If the serving team wins the rally, it scores a point and continues to serve. If the receiving team wins the rally, it scores a point and gains the serve. Each time a team gains the serve, it must rotate one position clockwise before serving.

Page 11 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Rule 1-4 ART. 3 . . . A loss of rally/point is awarded each time a vacant position rotates to serve in the right back position. (Recorded on the scoresheet as regular loss of rally/point.) SECTION 4 THE SET ART. 1 . . . The first four sets shall be 25 points (no cap), and a team must win by at least two points. ART. 2 . . .

A continuous center line, 2 inches (or 5 centimeters) wide, parallel to and equidistant from the end lines, shall separate the court into two playing areas. NOTE: A solid or shadow-bordered 2-inch (or 5 cm) wide center line is permissible. A shadow line is a line that designates the required 2-inch (or 5 cm) width by use of border or outline lines at least ¼-inch (.64 cm) wide, which shall be within the 2-inch (or 5 cm) width. Border lines that are the natural color of the court are permissible. The area within these lines need not be one color but the continuous 2-inch (or 5 cm) wide outline must be clearly visible to the officials. If the floor has a logo in the center of the court, that logo should not distract from the visibility of the center line. ART. 5 . . . An attack line shall be solid and of one clearly visible color, 2 inches (or 5 centimeters) wide, and shall be drawn across each playing area from sideline to sideline, 10 feet (or 3 meters) from the center line and parallel to it measured from the edge of the attack line farthest from the center line to the axis of the center line.

Page 13 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Rule 2-2 ART. 6 . . . A serving area which is 30 feet (or 9 meters) wide shall be provided behind and excluding the end line. It shall be laterally limited by two short lines, each 6 inches (or 15 centimeters) long by 2 inches (or 5 centimeters) wide, drawn 8 inches (or 20 centimeters) behind and perpendicular to the end line, as exten- sions of the sidelines. Both lines are included in the width of the serving area. Each serving area shall be a minimum of 6 feet (or 2 meters) in depth. In the event that such a space is not available, the serving area shall extend into the court to whatever distance necessary to provide the minimum depth and be so marked. (Diagrams 1 and 2 in the front of the rules book.) ART. 7 . . . The substitution zone is the area near the sideline between the attack line and the center line. ART. 8 . . . The libero replacement zone is the area near the sideline between the attack line and the end line. ART. 9 . . . The coaching zone is the area defined as the libero replacement zone and the area beyond the end line and sideline extended. ART. 10 . . . The playable area includes the court and the unobstructed space outside of the court boundary lines. The playable area outside of the court bound- ary lines shall be visible to all team members and officials. ART. 11 . . . Nonplayable area is that space located beyond the court and sur- rounding playable area. It includes walls, bleachers, team benches, area behind the team benches, and any other areas identified in the prematch conference, deemed by the first referee as unsuitable for playable area. SECTION 2 PLAYABLE OVERHEAD OBSTRUCTIONS A ball striking the ceiling or an overhead obstruction above a playable area shall remain in play provided the ball contacts the ceiling or obstruction on the side of the net extended that is occupied by the team that last played the ball, and the ball is legally played next by the same team. SECTION 3 OUT OF BOUNDS A ball is out of bounds and becomes dead when it: a. Touches a wall, curtains serving as a wall, objects mounted flush with a wall, or objects on the floor outside the court that do not interfere with a player's legitimate effort to play the ball; b. Touches the floor completely outside the court's boundary lines, with no part of the ball in contact with the boundary line(s); c. Touches the net antennas above or within the net or does not pass over the net entirely between the net antennas; d. Touches the net cables or net not completely inside the antenna, net supports or first referee's platform; e. Touches a non-team member who is not interfering with a player's legiti- mate effort to play the ball; f. Touches the ceiling or overhead obstructions beyond the vertical plane of the net and its out-of-bounds extension;

Rule 2-4 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 14 g. Touches or enters (from the direction of the court) a nonplayable area be- yond the legal reach of a player, or adjacent courts scheduled for play; h. Touches any part of a backboard or its supports hanging in a vertical po- sition, over a playable area if it is a served ball or, in the judgment of the referee, the ball would not have remained in play if the backboard had not been there; i. Touches any part of a backboard or its supports hanging in a vertical posi- tion over the service area when tossed for serve and shall not be subject to a re-serve; j. Touches the cable(s) and/or diagonal pole(s) used to retract a ceiling-sus- pended net system located on one side of the net, and in the judgment of the referee, the ball would have not remained in play if the cable(s) and/or pole(s) had not been there. PENALTY: Loss of rally/point is awarded to the opponent. SECTION 4 RESTRICTED PLAY ART. 1 . . . A referee shall stop play when: a. A wall, floor obstacle, nonplayable area or non-team member interferes with a player's legitimate effort to play the ball; b. A player gains an advantage by contacting any floor obstacle (team bench- es, officials' table, bleachers, etc.), wall or team members; c. It is necessary to prevent player injury from contact with obstacles or walls; d. The ball contacts any part of a backboard or its supports which is hanging in a vertical position over a playable area. Supports are considered part of a backboard; e. The ball contacts the cable(s) and/or diagonal pole(s) which are used to retract a ceiling-suspended net system and located on one side of the net. ART. 2 . . . A player may play a ball over a nonplayable area if the player has a body part in contact with a playable area at the time the ball is contacted, and may enter the nonplayable area after playing the ball. EXCEPTION: When competition is scheduled to occur on adjacent courts, no player or ball may enter or break the plane of the adjacent court before, during or after playing the ball. PENALTIES: 1. When a wall, floor obstacle or nonplayable area that is less than 6 feet (2 meters) from a boundary line, or a non-team member causes the in- terference, a replay is declared provided the player had a legitimate play on the ball. 2. When, in the judgment of the referee, the ball would have remained in play had the vertical backboard not been over the playable area, a replay is granted. 3. When, in the judgment of the referee, the ball would have remained in play had the cable(s) and/or diagonal pole(s) not been there, a replay is granted. 4. In all other situations, a loss of rally/point is awarded to the opponent.

Page 15 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules SECTION 5 NON-TEAM MEMBERS Non-team members include but are not limited to all authorized officials, media personnel (including equipment) and spectators located in playable areas. Rule 3-1 r Rule 3 Game Equipment The NFHS does not perform scientific tests on any specific items of equipment to de- termine if the equipment poses undue risks to student-athletes, coaches, officials or spectators. Such determinations are the responsibility of equipment manufacturers. SECTION 1 THE NET AND MARKINGS ART. 1 . . . The net shall be 36 inches to 39 inches (or 1 meter) wide overall and at least 31'6" (or 9.5 meters) up to 33 feet (or 10 meters) in length when stretched.

If the libero player's uniform number is the same as the player's non-libero uniform number, it is not necessary to identify the libero number on the roster. The libero number shall not be a duplicate of any other player on the roster. PENALTIES: 1. Failure to submit a roster to the second referee at the prematch confer- ence results in an unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card) as- sessed at the start of the set. 2. Any corrections made to the roster after 10 minutes remain on the pre- game clock results in a loss of rally/point awarded to the opponent when the inaccuracy is discovered. 3. Failure to list on the roster a player/substitute entering the set results in a loss of rally/point being awarded to the opponent. The player/substi- tute may enter the set after the roster is corrected. NOTE: When a player's number changes due to blood on or damage to the uniform, the roster is corrected, and no penalty is assessed. (11-4-3) ART. 2 . . . Lineup: a. No later than two minutes prior to the end of timed prematch warmup, a coach from each team shall submit to the second referee an accurate,

Rule 7-1 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 34 written lineup listing the uniform numbers for the six starting players in the proper serving order. Only one libero may be designated per set and shall be designated on the lineup sheet prior to each set. b. Thereafter, the written lineup shall not be changed except between sets of a match (no later than one minute remaining in the timed interval or inter- mission when used), for a legal substitution prior to the start of the set, or to replace a starting player who is injured/ill prior to the start of the set. c. One of the six starting players on the lineup sheet or the libero must be des- ignated as the playing captain by placing a "C" next to the player's number. ART. 3 . . . The written rosters and current lineups shall remain at the officials' table throughout each set. ART. 4 . . . No later than one minute remaining in the timed interval, or inter- mission when used, following each set, a coach from each team shall submit a written, accurate numeric lineup in proper serving order to the second referee. a. If a team submits its lineup and lists a number that no team member is wearing, the team shall: 1. Legally substitute a player with a legal number into that position. The team is charged with a substitution. 2. Change the incorrect libero number to the legal libero number (no pen- alty is assessed). b. If a lineup is submitted with a player's number duplicated in more than one starting position (including the libero), the error shall be corrected by revising the submitted lineup in one of two ways to ensure six unique, legal player numbers to start the set. 1. Change the listed libero with the duplicate number to a different legal number. 2. Use a substitution to change the starting player to a different legal num- ber into that position. PENALTIES: 1. Failure to submit to the second referee no later than two minutes prior to the end of timed prematch warmup, a written, accurate numeric lineup [except as addressed in items (a) and (b) above, 7-1-4] results in an unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card) assessed at the start of that set.

Failure to submit a complete and written accurate numeric lineup [except as addressed in items (a) and (b) above, 7-1-4] to the second referee no later than one minute remaining in the timed interval or intermission when used results in an unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card) assessed at the start of the next set. If the lineup has not been submitted by the end of the timed interval or intermission when used, a subsequent unnecessary delay (administrative red card) shall be assessed to the offending team at the start of the next set, resulting in a loss of rally/point awarded to the opponent.

Page 35 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Rule 8-1 r Rule 8 The Serve SECTION 1 DEFINITION ART. 1 . . . A serve is contact with the ball to initiate play. The server shall hit the ball with one hand, fist or arm while the ball is held, or after it is released by the server.

A serve contacting and crossing the net shall remain in play pro- vided the ball is entirely within the net antennas. ART. 2 . . . The server shall serve from within the serving area (2-1-6) and shall not touch the end line or the floor outside the lines marking the width of the serving area at the instant the ball is contacted for the serve. The server's body may be in the air over or beyond the serving area boundary lines, having left the floor from within the serving area. ART. 3 . . . A team's term of service begins when a player assumes the right back position as the server and ends when a loss of rally is awarded. ART. 4 . . . For teams with fewer than six players, each time a vacant position rotates to serve in the right back position, a loss of rally/point is awarded to the opponent. ART. 5 . . . A player's term of service begins when the player assumes the right back position as the server and ends when a loss of rally is awarded or a substi- tution for the player is made prior to the end of the team's term of service. Each player may have only one re-serve during a team's term of service. ART. 6 . . . A re-serve shall be called when the server releases the ball for ser- vice, then catches it or it drops to the floor. The first referee shall cancel the serve and direct a second and last attempt at serve. The server is allowed a new five seconds for the re-serve. A tossed ball that contacts a backboard or its supports hanging in a vertical position over the serving area is an illegal serve and not eligible for a re-serve. (Signal 13) A re-serve is considered to be a part of a single attempt to serve. Therefore, af- ter the first referee's signal for service, no requests, e.g., time-out, service order, lineup, substitution, libero replacement, etc., may be recognized until after the ball has been served. SECTION 2 GENERAL ART. 1 . . . The first server of the set is the right back position. Thereafter, when a team is awarded a loss of rally, the player in the right front position rotates to the serving area. ART. 2 . . .

Touches one of the server's teammates; (Signal 6) 3. Touches the floor on the server's side of the net. (Signal 6) b. Crosses the net not entirely between the net antennas, or lands out of bounds; (Signal 13) c. Touches the ceiling or any obstruction. (Signal 13) ART. 7 . . . When a receiving team player is out of position on the serve and: a. The ball is served illegally, the serving team is penalized; b. A service fault occurs, the receiving team is penalized. PENALTIES: 1. For an illegal serve, a service fault, or the serving team being out of position when there is an illegal serve, loss of rally/point is awarded to the receiving team. 2. For the receiving team being out of position when there is a service fault, a point is awarded to the serving team. 3.

Page 39 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Rule 9-5 c. A "joust" occurs when two opponents cause the ball to come to rest above the net through simultaneous contact. A "joust" is not a fault, and play con- tinues as if the contact was instantaneous. d. When opposing players contact the ball at the same instant, the player on the opposite side of the net from which the ball falls shall be considered the player to have touched the ball last. The other player may participate in the next play and the simultaneous contact shall not count as a hit. ART. 7 . . .

ART. 2 . . . A replay is considered to be a part of a single play action. Therefore, once a replay is signaled by the first referee, no requests, e.g., time-out, service order, lineup, substitution, libero replacement, etc., may be recognized until after the replay. EXCEPTION: When a replay is signaled due to an injury/illness, see Rule 11-4-1. SECTION 9 UNNECESSARY DELAY ART. 1 . . .

Cards issued for unsporting conduct carry over from set to set throughout the match. Procedure for Unsporting Conduct Violations 1. The first referee, as the head official, sets the tone for the match and shall be responsible for controlling the unsporting conduct of coaches, players and/ or other team personnel. Therefore, only the first referee shall administer the cards as follows: a. Whistle and hold the card(s) in the hand(s) on the offending team's side of the court with the arm outstretched, elbow bent 90 degrees and hand(s) held head-high; b. Indicate to the second referee the number of the player(s) or which coach is receiving the card. The first referee should be sure that the second ref- eree also has identified the offender(s) and verified that the scorer has recorded the information on the scoresheet. Under no circumstances shall the referees permit unsporting conduct to occur without a penalty. If there are multiple offenses, each offender shall be penalized. 2. When the second referee sees or hears an action or response that neces- sitates a card, the second referee shall move to the offending team's side of the net and take a few steps onto the court toward the first referee. The second referee holds the card(s) in the middle of the chest and indicates

Rule 12-3 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 54 verbally the number of the offending player(s) or coach. It is the responsi- bility of the first referee to immediately whistle and administer any card(s) requested by the second referee. 3. Yellow Conduct Card (warning): A yellow card is administered by the first referee at the first dead ball. The yellow conduct card (YC) shall be recorded in the Comments section on the scoresheet. No penalty point is assessed. 4. Red Conduct Card (penalty): A red card is administered at the first dead ball. The red conduct card (RC) is recorded in the Comments section and the penalty is noted in the individual scoring section on the scoresheet; loss of rally/point awarded to opponent. 5. Disqualification: The yellow and red cards are displayed apart (usually at the first dead ball). The offender may be removed from the vicinity of the team bench provided there is authorized school personnel available to su- pervise. (When the offender is a coach or other adult team personnel, the offender shall be removed from the premises.) The referee shall notify the appropriate head coach of the reason for the disqualification. The disqualifi- cation is recorded in the Comments section of the scoresheet; loss of rally/ point awarded to opponent. 6. Forfeit, if awarded to the opponent, shall be recorded on the scoresheet. 7. If the situation warrants, the first referee may issue a red card or a yellow and red card on a first unsporting conduct violation. 8. The second referee shall direct the scorer to record the proper notations and verify that the scorer has recorded them. 9. All cards issued for unsporting conduct carry over from set to set through- out the match. The second referee may keep notations on the lineup card. The scorer shall notify the second referee of any previous violations by the same individual. 10. When unsporting conduct occurs from the bench or court and the referees cannot determine the specific offender(s), the warning or penalty is issued to the head coach. 11. Any cards issued for unsporting conduct prior to the first set or between sets shall be administered at the beginning of the set immediately following the violation. After lineups are recorded, the card(s) is recorded in the Com- ments section on the scoresheet for the set in which it is administered. 12. Requests such as time-out, serving order check, substitution, etc., shall not be recognized until after the card(s) is administered. 13. If the team captain asks in a proper manner, the first referee shall give the reason for the penalty, but shall not permit further discussion of the penalty. SECTION 3 UNSPORTING CONDUCT: SPECTATORS When a spectator becomes unruly or interferes with the orderly progress of the set, the first referee shall suspend the set until the host management resolves the situation and the set can proceed in an orderly manner. NOTE: In the absence of a designated school representative, the home head coach shall serve as the host management.

4-2-3 NOTE (NEW), 7-1-1 NOTE — A new NOTE has been added to Rule 4 Uni- forms addressing when it is legal to change a player’s uniform number aligning the language with Rule 7 Roster and Lineup. This change also expands to include a damaged uniform as a legal reason for changing a uniform number. It is now legal for a player to change their jersey and uniform number without penalty if the uniform is damaged or has blood on it. 5-4-3c(1) — It is now permissible for a team to include all players on the roster, not just starting players, in the prematch announcements by allowing them to stand on their respective end lines prior to the first set. State associations and/ or teams may continue to limit players on the end line to starting players and the libero. This change allows for the inclusion of all players but does not mandate inclusion. 5-9-2b NOTE (NEW), State Association Adoption Chart — Line judges are now required to switch sides of the court between sets to promote fair officiating when, by state association adoption, teams remain on the same benches throughout the match. When teams switch sides of the court between sets and the line judges re- main in their position throughout the match, teams have the equitable opportunity to alternate between line judges overseeing the lines. This change provides the same equitable opportunity regardless of state adoption. 11-4-1b — Teams may substitute during an injury time-out (even though a replay is called) for the libero replacement if the libero is injured or ill. This change allows for the immediate substitution of the libero replacement who may be play- ing out of position due to the injury to the libero. While a replay limits a team from substituting, when the replay is called due to an injury of the libero, a substitute is allowed for the libero replacement.

2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 56 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCORER The NFHS Official Volleyball Scorebook provides an accurate method of scor- ing. Scoresheets are designed to accommodate 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5 set matches. There is a Comments section for recording cards issued for unsport- ing conduct, administrative cards issued for unnecessary delay, disqualification, player removed under concussion management, re-designation of libero or an exceptional substitution. SCORING Each square represents one play or action such as a serve, a substitution or a time-out. Each play should be recorded as such using the appropriate figure in the key accompanying the scoresheet. The squares, unless otherwise indicated, represent a serve. If a point is scored on the serve, the respective point shall be recorded. If the serve resulted in a loss of rally, replay or penalty, the appropriate figure shall be inserted. As each point is scored, the appropriate number should be marked in the running score section. PREMATCH The scorer shall: a. Have access to blue, black and red ink pens or pencils to record alternate rotations during the set. b. Record all the information on the header of the scoresheet in blue or black ink, including the team name, site, date, set number and names of the officials. c. After the coin toss, indicate the serving team with an X in the appropriate box. d. Review the lineups to ensure that a captain is indicated (C), no duplicate or illegal numbers are entered, and the libero's number is noted. If no libero is indicated, as a courtesy, the scorer or libero tracker may notify the second referee to confirm with the coach that no libero will be used in that set. e. Record the lineups on the scoresheet including the libero player number. The starting player numbers of each team are recorded in the appropriate spaces under the "Player No." heading. The Roman numerals represent the service order. NOTE: The scorer and libero tracker are part of the officiating crew. No comments about play shall be allowed from the assistant officials at the officials' table unless relevant to scoresheet or libero tracking sheet. No cheering or comments about play shall occur. DURING THE SET The scorer shall: a. Record the start time at the beckon of the first serve. b. Mark the appropriate number in the individual scoring section and in the running score column as each point is scored.

Page 57 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules c. Mark the appropriate symbol for loss of rally, replay, re-serve, time-out, substitution or penalty (See Key). d. Use a different color ink/pencil for subsequent new rotations in the individ- ual points section and the running team score. e. At the conclusion of the set, record the final score in blue/black ink/pencil, confirm that the final score in the individual section matches the running score, and record the ending time. NOTE: The second referee confirms the end of the set by initialing the scoresheet. RECORDING COMMENTS Cards issued for unsporting conduct, administrative cards issued for unnec- essary delay, disqualification, player removed under concussion management, re-designation of libero or an exceptional substitution shall be recorded in the Comments section of the scoresheet.

Page 61 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIBERO TRACKER An individual other than the scorer must be provided to track the entries of the libero play- er. The home team is responsible for obtaining a libero tracker (5-1-1). This libero tracker is charged with tracking the libero replacements. There are two important procedures that the libero tracker is responsible for enforcing. The first procedure is to assure that once the libero is replaced, at least one rally/deadball must take place before the libero can replace another player unless the libero assumes the serving position. The second procedure is to ensure that when the libero leaves the court, the player replacing the libero must be the same player that the libero replaced when the libero last entered the set. SCORER AND LIBERO TRACKER DUTIES Before the start of each set, the scorer shall: a. Obtain the lineup sheets from the second referee and record the uniform numbers of the starting players in serving order and the libero on the scoresheet; b. Ensure that the libero tracker accurately records the lineups on the libero tracking sheet. After the toss of the coin and before each set, the scorer and libero tracker shall: a. Review the lineups submitted to ensure that a captain is indicated, no duplicate or illegal numbers are entered, and the libero's number is noted. If no libero is indicat- ed, as a courtesy the scorer or libero tracker may, but is not obligated to, notify the second referee so the coach can verify that no libero will be utilized in the current set. b. Record the team information and the positions of the players on the court according to the serving order on the lineup sheet. After the coin toss and before each set, the libero tracker shall: a. Record all libero replacements accurately so the libero tracking sheet reflects the players actually on the court at all times. b. If an incorrect libero replacement occurs, notify the second referee unless the team immediately corrects the replacement with no delay. During the match the libero tracker shall: a. Record all substitutions and libero replacements on the libero tracking sheet. b. Notify the officials if the libero is replaced by an incorrect player or if an undesignated libero enters the set. c. Notify the officials if the libero does not remain out of the set for one rally between replacements, unless the libero assumes the serving position. d. Communicate and coordinate with the scorer to ensure accuracy of both the score- sheet and the libero tracking sheet. e. At the beginning of a time-out, report the status of each team's libero to the second referee. TRACKING SHEET 1. Enter Home and Visiting team on Tracking Sheet. 2. Next to L: put the # of the Libero being used for that set. If no libero is being used, no tracking will take place. 3. Enter in the "SP" column the starting players for each team. This should be an exact match of the lineup entry on the scoresheet. 4. When a libero enters the set as a replacement, place an "L" on the line next to the number.

2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 62 5. The player the libero comes into the set for can only be the libero replacement. Re- cord the number of the player that must be the same number of the player as the number before the "L" (i.e., 23 L 23). 6. When the libero is replaced (again, by the same player), the number of the player is recorded next on the line. 7. If a libero in the set assumes the serving position, record the "L" for the player being replaced and record the number of the player who was last replaced by the libero on the tracking sheet. 8. The libero tracker also records all substitutions. When a player (not a libero) is sub- stituted out of the set, the player's number is crossed off and the player's number entering the set is written on the line. 9. There are unlimited libero replacements but only 18 substitutions per set. NOTE: A different libero can be designated for each set, but the designation must be made on the lineup sheet when it is submitted to the official scorer before the set. S A M P L E Enter the libero's number next to the L: located at the top right of each tracking sheet. Enter the num- ber of the starting player (SP) for each position in the serve order under SP. When the libero enters, record the L. When the libero is replaced, record the replacement player's number. When a player (not a libero) is substituted out of the set, the player's number is crossed off and the player's number entering the set is recorded. If the libero serves, place a triangle around the serving order position in which the libero served. (Order by calling 1-800-776-3462 or visit www.nfhs.com) 5 14 L 14 L 14 7 L 7 (7 subs for 14)

Page 74 EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES 1. Each NFHS sports rules committee is responsible for recommending the official playing rules to the NFHS Board of Directors for adoption. The committee is NOT responsible for testing or approving playing equipment for use in interscholastic sports. Equipment manufacturers are responsible for the development of playing equipment that meets the specifications established by the committee, and that is otherwise of good design and quality. The NFHS urges manufacturers to work with the various independent testing agencies to ensure the production of safe products. Neither the NFHS nor the applicable NFHS sport rules committee certifies the safety of any sport equipment. Non-compliant equipment is inappropriate for use in competition under NFHS sports rules. While the committee does not regulate the development of new equipment and does not set technical or scientific standards for testing equipment, the committee may, from time to time, provide manufacturers with guidance as to the equipment-performance levels it considers consistent with the integrity of the game. The committee reserves the right to intercede to protect and maintain that integrity. 2. Each NFHS sport rules committee suggests that manufacturers planning innovative changes in sports equipment submit the equipment to the applicable NFHS sport rules editor and/or rules committee for review before production. 3. Protective headgear is required by NFHS rules in some sports and is permissive in others. Hard helmets can decrease the incidence of certain head trauma, such as skull fractures and subdural hematomas. Soft headgear may protect against cuts and bruises to the scalp and forehead. Coaches, athletes and parents/guardians should review the manufacturers’ warnings about proper usage and performance limits of such products. No helmet or headgear can eliminate the risk of concussion and all sports should be played, coached and officiated in recognition of that fact.

Page 75 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Appendix D GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SPORTS HYGIENE, SKIN INFECTIONS AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Proper precautions are needed to minimize the potential risk of the spread of communicable disease and skin infections during athletic competition. These conditions include skin infections that occur due to skin contact with competitors and equipment. The transmission of infections such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Herpes Gladiatorum, blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B, and other infectious diseases such as Influenza and COVID-19 can often be greatly reduced through proper hygiene. The NFHS SMAC has outlined and listed below some general guidelines for the prevention of the spread of these diseases. UNIVERSAL HYGIENE PROTOCOL FOR ALL SPORTS: BLOOD-BORNE INFECTIOUS DISEASES • Shower immediately after every competition and practice, Strategies for reducing the potential exposure to these agents using liquid soap and not a shared bar soap; include following Universal Precautions such as: • Wash all workout clothing after each practice, washing in • A student who is bleeding, has an open wound, has any hot water and drying on a high heat setting; amount of blood on a uniform, or has blood on their body, • Clean and/or wash all personal gear (knee pads, head gear, shall be directed to leave the activity (game or practice) braces, etc.) and gym bags at least weekly; until the bleeding is stopped, the wound is covered, the • Do not share towels or personal hygiene products (razors) uniform and/or body is appropriately cleaned, and/or the with others; uniform is changed before returning to activity; • Refrain from full body and/or cosmetic shaving of head, • Athletic trainers or other caregivers must wear gloves chest, arms, legs, abdomen, and groin; and use Universal Precautions to prevent blood or body • Students should clean hands with an alcohol-based gel or fluid-splash from contaminating themselves or others; soap and water before and after every practice and contest • In the event of a blood or body fluid-splash, immediately to decrease bacterial load on the hands; wash contaminated skin or mucous membranes with soap • Covering up coughs and sneezes in the bend of the elbow and water. Skin antiseptics (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) or moist instead of the hand; towelettes may be used if soap and water not available; • Stay home from school and athletic participation if frequent • Clean all contaminated surfaces and equipment with cough, diarrhea, vomiting or fever. disinfectant before returning to competition. Be sure to use gloves when cleaning; INFECTIOUS SKIN DISEASES • Blood on an opponent’s uniform during competition or Strategies for reducing the potential exposure to these teammate’s uniform during practice should be cleaned at infectious agents include: that time by wiping with a disinfectant such as isopropyl • Students must notify a parent/guardian and coach of any alcohol; skin lesion prior to any competition or practice.

All shared equipment shall be properly cleaned/disinfected prior to use; • Coaches, officials, and appropriate health-care profession- als must follow NFHS or state/local guidelines on “time until return to competition.” Participation with a covered lesion may be considered if in accordance with NFHS, state or local guidelines and the lesion is no longer contagious. OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Means of reducing the potential exposure to these agents include: • Make certain that students, coaching staff, and medical staff are current on all required vaccinations (MMR, Hepatitis B, Chickenpox, Meningitis, Hepatitis A). COVID-19 vaccine and yearly influenza vaccine are strongly encouraged; • During times of outbreaks, follow the guidelines set forth by the CDC as well as State and local Health Depart- ments. For more detailed information, refer to the “Blood-Borne Pathogens,” “Infectious Mononucleosis” and “Skin Conditions and Infections” sections contained in the NFHS Sports Medicine Handbook. Revised and Approved in January 2022

Appendix E 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 76 COACHES CODE OF ETHICS The function of a coach is to educate students through participation in interscholastic competition. An interscholastic program should be designed to enhance academic achievement and should never interfere with opportunities for academic success. Each student should be treated with the utmost respect and the student’s welfare should be considered in decisions by the coach at all times. Accordingly, the following guidelines for coaches have been adopted by the NFHS Board of Directors: • Coaches shall be aware that they have a tremendous influence, for either good or ill, on the education of the student and, thus, shall never place the value of winning above the value of instilling the highest ideals of character. • Coaches shall uphold the honor and dignity of the profession. In all personal contact with students, officials, athletic directors, school administrators and staff, the state high school athletic association, the media, parents, and the public, coaches shall strive to set an example of the highest ethical and moral conduct. Communication with all parties should be wholesome, appropriate and positive. • Coaches shall respect and support contest officials. Coaches shall not indulge in conduct which would incite players or spectators against the officials. Public criticism of officials or players is unethical and inappropriate. • Coaches shall take an active role in the prevention of drug, alcohol, tobacco and other substance abuse. • Coaches shall avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco products when in contact with players. • Coaches shall promote the entire interscholastic program of the school and direct the program in harmony with the total school program. • Coaches shall master the contest rules and shall teach the rules to their team members. • Coaches shall not seek an advantage by circumvention of the spirit or letter of the rules. • Coaches shall utilize their positive influence to enhance sportsmanship by spectators, both directly and by working closely with cheerleaders, other school club sponsors, booster clubs and administrators. • Coaches shall promote a culture that encourages diversity and inclusion. • Coaches shall ensure they familiarize themselves and their teams with their schools’ emergency action plans and, where applicable, with concussion and heat illness prevention plans. • Coaches should meet and exchange cordial greetings with the opposing coach to set the positive example and correct tone for the event before and after the contest. • Coaches shall not exert pressure on faculty members to give students special consideration. • Coaches shall not scout opponents by any means other than those adopted by the league and/or state high school association.

OFFICIALS CODE OF ETHICS Officials at an interscholastic athletic event are participants in the educational development of high school students. As such, they must exercise a high level of self-discipline, independence and responsibility. The purpose of this Code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all interscholastic officials. • Officials shall master both the rules of the game and the mechanics necessary to enforce the rules, and shall exercise authority in an impartial, firm and controlled manner. • Officials shall work with each other and their state associations in a constructive and cooperative manner. • Officials shall uphold the honor and dignity of the profession in all interaction with student-athletes, coaches, athletic directors, school administrators, colleagues, and the public. This includes, but is not limited to, positive verbal and nonverbal communication with coaches, bench personnel and players. • Officials shall avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco products beginning with the arrival at the competition site until departure following the completion of the contest. • Officials shall prepare themselves both physically and mentally, shall dress neatly and appropriately, and shall comport themselves in a manner consistent with the high standards of the profession. • Officials shall be punctual and professional in the fulfillment of all contractual obligations. • Officials shall remain mindful that their conduct influences the respect that student-athletes, coaches and the public hold for the profession. • Officials shall, while enforcing the rules of play, remain aware of the inherent risk of injury that competition poses to student-athletes. Where appropriate, officials shall inform event manage- ment of conditions or situations that appear unreasonably hazardous. • Officials shall take reasonable steps to educate themselves in the recognition of emergency conditions that might arise during the course of competition. • Officials shall maintain an ethical approach while participating in forums, chat rooms and all forms of social media.
