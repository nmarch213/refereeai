## SECTION 4 CONTACTING THE BALL

### ART. 1
A contact is any touch of the ball by a player (excluding the player's loose hair).

### ART. 2
A hit is a contact/touch of the ball which is counted as one of the team's three allowable plays before the ball is returned to the opponent's side of the court.

### ART. 3
A team shall not have more than three hits before the ball crosses the net into the opponent's playing area or is touched by the opponent. When the team's first contact is simultaneous contact by opponents, or an action to block, the next contact is considered the team's first hit.

### ART. 4
A ball is considered to have crossed the net when:
1. It has passed completely beyond the vertical plane of the net;
2. It is partially over the net and is contacted by an opponent;
3. No part of the ball has crossed the net, and it is legally blocked.

### ART. 5
Legal contact is a touch of the ball by any part of a player's body which does not allow the ball to visibly come to rest or involve prolonged contact with a player's body.

### ART. 6
Simultaneous contact is more than one contact of the ball made at the same instant.
- a. When one player contacts the ball with two or more parts of the body at the same instant, it is permitted and considered one hit (except for a block which does not count as a hit).
- b. When teammates contact the ball at the same instant, it is permitted and considered one hit (except a block which does not count as a hit). Any player may attempt the next hit, provided the simultaneous contact was not the team's third hit.
