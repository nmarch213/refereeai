## Player Equipment and Uniform {#section-player-equipment-and-uniform}

The NFHS does not perform scientific tests on any specific items of equipment to determine if the equipment poses undue risks to student-athletes, coaches, officials, or spectators. Such determinations are the responsibility of equipment manufacturers.

### SECTION 1: EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES {#subsection-equipment-and-accessories}

**NOTES:**
1. Prior to the match, head coaches shall verify with the first referee that all their players are legal and wearing legal uniforms and equipment.
2. Each state association may, in keeping with applicable laws, authorize exceptions to NFHS playing rules to provide reasonable accommodations to individual participants with disabilities or unique and extenuating circumstances. The accommodations should not fundamentally alter the sport, heighten risk to the athlete/others, or place opponents at a disadvantage.

### ART. 1 {#rule-4-1-art-1}
A guard, cast, or brace made of hard and unyielding leather, plaster, pliable (soft) plastic, metal, or any other hard substance shall not be worn on the hand, finger, wrist, or forearm, even though covered with soft padding.

### ART. 2 {#rule-4-1-art-2}
Hard and unyielding items (guards, casts, braces, etc.) on the elbow, upper arm, or shoulder shall be padded with a closed-cell, slow-recovery foam padding no less than Â½-inch thick. An elbow brace shall not extend more than halfway down the forearm.

### ART. 3 {#rule-4-1-art-3}
Knee and ankle braces, which are unaltered from the manufacturer's original design/production, do not require any additional padding.

### ART. 4 {#rule-4-1-art-4}
A protective face mask made of hard material may be worn but must be molded to the face with no protrusions.

### ART. 5 {#rule-4-1-art-5}
Any equipment that in the judgment of the first referee increases a player's advantage or presents a safety concern is prohibited.

### ART. 6 {#rule-4-1-art-6}
Head and hair devices must adhere to the following:
- a. Hair-control devices and other adornments in the hair that are securely fastened and do not present an increased risk to the player, teammates, or opponents are allowed;
- b. Headbands made of soft material and no more than 3 inches wide may be worn in the hair or on the head;
- c. Head coverings worn for religious reasons are not considered hair devices; must be made of non-abrasive or soft materials; and must fit securely;
- d. Head coverings worn for medical reasons require state association approval. (4-1 NOTES 2)
