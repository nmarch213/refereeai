## Rule 4-2

### 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules

1. The school's name, nickname, logo, mascot and/or team member's name are permitted on the uniform top and/or bottom;
2. A single partial/whole manufacturer's logo/trademark/reference, no more than 2¼ square inches with no dimension more than 2¼ inches, is permitted on each piece of the uniform provided placement does not interfere with the visibility of the player's number. Manufacturer's logo/trademark/reference restrictions do not apply to waistbands on uniform bottoms;
3. One American flag, not to exceed 2 inches by 3 inches, may be worn or occupy space on each item of uniform apparel. By state association adoption, to allow for special occasions, commemorative or memorial patches, not to exceed 4 square inches, may be worn on the uniform without compromising its integrity.

#### Uniform Top
1. Bare-midriff tops are not allowed.
2. The uniform top shall hang below or be tucked into the waistband of the uniform bottom when the player is standing upright.
3. Any visible garment (t-shirt, body suits and other similar garments) worn underneath the uniform top shall be unadorned and of a single, solid color that is similar in color to the predominant color of the uniform top.

#### Like-Colored Uniform Bottom
1. Multiple styles of uniform bottoms may be worn by teammates and may include: shorts, spandex, pants or skirts.
2. A visible undergarment may be worn under the uniform bottom. It shall be unadorned and of a single, solid color similar to the predominant color of the uniform bottom and may extend below the uniform bottom.

### ART. 2
The libero uniform top must clearly contrast from the predominant color(s) of the team uniform top, excluding trim. The libero's uniform top cannot be made solely of the same predominant color(s) of the team's uniform top, even if the like color(s) are placed differently on the uniform top. Numbers shall meet all specifications in [Rule 4-2-4](#rule-4-2-4).

### ART. 3
Each player, including the libero, shall be identified by a number on the uniform top which is not a duplicate of a teammate's number. 

> **NOTE:** When a player’s number changes due to blood on or damage to the uniform, the roster is corrected, and no penalty is assessed.

### ART. 4
The number shall be:
1. Permanent and clearly visible;
2. Not more than two digits (0-99). Beginning July 1, 2028, numbers with a leading zero are not legal (01, 02, etc.);
3. A plain, Arabic numeral of a solid color, where either the body of the number (measuring not less than ¾ inch in width at its narrowest point) or the surrounding solid color(s) of trim (a contrasting border not to exceed ½ inch in width at its widest point) is a color that is in sharp contrast to the color of the uniform top. A shadow on part of the number not to exceed ½ inch at its widest point is permitted but shall not be used to make the number clearly visible regardless of color. The body of the number must clearly contrast from the body of the uniform regardless of trim.
