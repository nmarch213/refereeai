## Instructions for Scorer

The NFHS Official Volleyball Scorebook provides an accurate method of scoring. Scoresheets are designed to accommodate 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5 set matches. There is a Comments section for recording cards issued for unsporting conduct, administrative cards issued for unnecessary delay, disqualification, player removed under concussion management, re-designation of libero or an exceptional substitution.

### Scoring

Each square represents one play or action such as a serve, a substitution or a time-out. Each play should be recorded as such using the appropriate figure in the key accompanying the scoresheet. The squares, unless otherwise indicated, represent a serve. If a point is scored on the serve, the respective point shall be recorded. If the serve resulted in a loss of rally, replay or penalty, the appropriate figure shall be inserted. As each point is scored, the appropriate number should be marked in the running score section.

### Prematch

The scorer shall:
1. Have access to blue, black and red ink pens or pencils to record alternate rotations during the set.
2. Record all the information on the header of the scoresheet in blue or black ink, including the team name, site, date, set number and names of the officials.
3. After the coin toss, indicate the serving team with an X in the appropriate box.
4. Review the lineups to ensure that a captain is indicated (C), no duplicate or illegal numbers are entered, and the libero's number is noted. If no libero is indicated, as a courtesy, the scorer or libero tracker may notify the second referee to confirm with the coach that no libero will be used in that set.
5. Record the lineups on the scoresheet including the libero player number. The starting player numbers of each team are recorded in the appropriate spaces under the "Player No." heading. The Roman numerals represent the service order.

> **NOTE:** The scorer and libero tracker are part of the officiating crew. No comments about play shall be allowed from the assistant officials at the officials' table unless relevant to scoresheet or libero tracking sheet. No cheering or comments about play shall occur.

### During the Set

The scorer shall:
1. Record the start time at the beckon of the first serve.
2. Mark the appropriate number in the individual scoring section and in the running score column as each point is scored.
