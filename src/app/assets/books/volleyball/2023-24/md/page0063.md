## Instructions for Libero Tracker

An individual other than the scorer must be provided to track the entries of the libero player. The home team is responsible for obtaining a libero tracker ([Rule 5-1-1](#rule-5-1-1)). This libero tracker is charged with tracking the libero replacements. There are two important procedures that the libero tracker is responsible for enforcing:

1. The first procedure is to assure that once the libero is replaced, at least one rally/deadball must take place before the libero can replace another player unless the libero assumes the serving position.
2. The second procedure is to ensure that when the libero leaves the court, the player replacing the libero must be the same player that the libero replaced when the libero last entered the set.

### Scorer and Libero Tracker Duties

Before the start of each set, the scorer shall:

a. Obtain the lineup sheets from the second referee and record the uniform numbers of the starting players in serving order and the libero on the scoresheet;  
b. Ensure that the libero tracker accurately records the lineups on the libero tracking sheet.

After the toss of the coin and before each set, the scorer and libero tracker shall:

a. Review the lineups submitted to ensure that a captain is indicated, no duplicate or illegal numbers are entered, and the libero's number is noted. If no libero is indicated, as a courtesy the scorer or libero tracker may, but is not obligated to, notify the second referee so the coach can verify that no libero will be utilized in the current set.  
b. Record the team information and the positions of the players on the court according to the serving order on the lineup sheet.

After the coin toss and before each set, the libero tracker shall:

a. Record all libero replacements accurately so the libero tracking sheet reflects the players actually on the court at all times.  
b. If an incorrect libero replacement occurs, notify the second referee unless the team immediately corrects the replacement with no delay.

During the match, the libero tracker shall:

a. Record all substitutions and libero replacements on the libero tracking sheet.  
b. Notify the officials if the libero is replaced by an incorrect player or if an undesignated libero enters the set.  
c. Notify the officials if the libero does not remain out of the set for one rally between replacements, unless the libero assumes the serving position.  
d. Communicate and coordinate with the scorer to ensure accuracy of both the scoresheet and the libero tracking sheet.  
e. At the beginning of a time-out, report the status of each team's libero to the second referee.

### Tracking Sheet

1. Enter Home and Visiting team on Tracking Sheet.
2. Next to L: put the # of the Libero being used for that set. If no libero is being used, no tracking will take place.
3. Enter in the "SP" column the starting players for each team. This should be an exact match of the lineup entry on the scoresheet.
4. When a libero enters the set as a replacement, place an "L" on the line next to the number.
