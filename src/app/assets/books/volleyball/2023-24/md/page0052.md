## Rule 11-4 #section-injury

### SECTION 4 INJURY

#### ART. 1
In the case of an injury/illness during the set, a referee may interrupt play and call a referee's time-out. If the injured/ill player cannot continue play within 30 seconds, the head coach shall:
- a. Request a substitution for the injured/ill player;
- b. Complete a legal libero replacement for the injured/ill player, and may substitute for the replacement player, or;
- c. Take a team time-out if the team has not used its allotted time-outs.

The set shall resume with a replay.

**NOTES:**
1. If the decision is made to substitute for the injured player, the team shall be allowed the necessary time to safely move the player from the court.
2. If a coach does not make a decision within 30 seconds, an unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card for the first offense or administrative red card for subsequent offense in that set) is charged.

#### ART. 2
In the case of a team having an injured/ill player who is unable to play at the end of an official's time-out regarding injury/illness and all other time-outs and no legal or exceptional substitute is available, the first referee may call a special injury time-out of up to three minutes for the injured/ill player to return. If the player cannot return by the conclusion of the special injury time-out, the team shall play short for the remainder of the set with appropriate penalty being assessed when the vacant position rotates to serve ([Rule 6-4-5](#rule-6-4-5)). Each player may be granted a single special injury time-out during the match.

#### ART. 3
An athlete who is bleeding, has an open wound, has any amount of blood on the uniform, or has blood on the athlete's body, shall be directed to leave the activity until the bleeding is stopped, the wound is covered, the uniform and/or body is appropriately cleaned, and/or the uniform is changed ([Appendix D](#appendix-d)).

#### ART. 4
In case of injury or illness to a starting player prior to a set, the injured/ill player is replaced in the lineup without penalty and no entry is charged to the injured or ill player.
