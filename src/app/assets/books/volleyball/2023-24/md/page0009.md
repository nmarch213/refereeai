## Prematch Procedures

The NFHS rules governing prematch procedures can be found in [Rule 1-6](#rule-1-6). It is recommended that state associations adopt prematch protocols including warm-up procedures similar to the examples provided below.

- The competition court should be set up and available at least one hour before the first scheduled match.
- A timed warm-up period for each team should be predetermined. The timed warm-up period will vary depending on facility and format of matches.
  - During shared warm-up, players may not intentionally or cause balls to intentionally enter the opponent’s court.
  - When one team has exclusive use of the court, the other team should be at its bench or off the playable area. Teams can utilize an auxiliary gym or the area behind the team bench if adequate space is available.
- Announcements – teams on their endlines for player introductions, national anthem, shaking hands, etc.
