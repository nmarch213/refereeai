## Rule 10-4

1. For the serving team, any points known to have been scored during a term of service in which an illegal substitute is discovered in the set shall be canceled.
2. For the receiving team prior to the contact of the serve by the opposing team, all points earned during the previous term of service by the violating team while the illegal substitute was in the set, shall be canceled.

<!-- Section: Libero Replacement -->

## SECTION 4: LIBERO REPLACEMENT

### ART. 1: Procedures for libero replacement

- The libero designated on the lineup for that set is allowed to replace any player in a back-row position. The libero may serve in one position in the serve order;
- The libero may only be replaced by the player whom the libero replaced;
- One libero replacement may be exercised per dead ball/rally unless the libero is replacing the player in the right back position and will serve the next rally;
- Libero replacements do not count as substitutions and are unlimited;
- A libero replacement shall take place between the attack line and the endline in front of that team's bench;
- A libero replacement shall be completed during a dead ball prior to the whistle and signal for serve.

### ART. 2: Replacements may only take place

- At the start of each set after the starting lineup has been checked;
- After the end of a rally;
- While the ball is out of play and prior to the whistle and signal for serve;
- After a time-out, once all players have returned to the court, provided the replacement sits out one rally/dead ball.

### ART. 3: Libero re-designation and disqualifications

- **Injury substitution** – If the libero is injured and cannot continue play, the libero shall first be replaced by the player whom the libero replaced. A new libero may then be re-designated using the following criteria:
  1. Re-designation does not need to occur immediately after the injury and replacement, but may occur at the discretion of the coach(es);
  2. Any substitute may be designated as the libero for the injured libero. The injured libero may not play in the remainder of that set;
  3. The player re-designated as the libero shall wear a libero uniform and shall remain the libero for the remainder of the set. The re-designated libero's uniform shall have a unique number (not worn by any teammate).
- **Exceptional substitution** – The libero may be used as an exceptional substitution for another injured player if no other possible substitute exists. When no longer playing as a libero, that player shall wear the same uniform as the teammates and the team continues play with no libero.
