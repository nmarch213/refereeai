## Rule 11-2

### SECTION 2 GENERAL

#### ART. 1
Requests for time-outs shall be signaled or verbalized by the head coach or playing captain only during dead balls, but shall not be honored after the first referee has signaled for the next serve.

#### ART. 2
A time-out requested prior to the start of the set shall be honored.

#### ART. 3
Charged time-outs begin when a referee recognizes the request with the whistle and signal. A time-out will last for a maximum of 60 seconds, unless both teams are ready to play. Each team is limited to two time-outs per set. Requests for additional time-outs shall be denied and the requesting team penalized. Time-outs may be taken consecutively without play between them.

> **NOTE:** State associations may determine the number, length and protocol of electronic media time-outs for matches that are transmitted and may reduce the number of charged time-outs when there are scheduled electronic media time-outs.

#### ART. 4
During referees' or team time-outs, teams may confer with their coaches only on their court or at their team bench area.

### PENALTIES:
1. For a team not conferring in the specified area or delaying its return to the court after a time-out, unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card for the first offense or administrative red card for subsequent offense in that set) shall be assessed.
2. For a team requesting a time-out in a set after it has taken its allotted time-outs, unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card for the first offense or administrative red card for subsequent offense in that set) shall be assessed.

### SECTION 3 REVIEWING DECISIONS

#### ART. 1
To review a decision by a referee that may have resulted in an incorrect decision, the head coach may request and be granted a time-out, provided the request is made during the dead ball immediately following the situation in which the possible incorrect decision occurred. When a time-out is so granted, the head coach shall confer with the first referee at the first referee's platform. If the conference results in the first referee altering the ruling, the opposing coach shall be notified by the second referee, the revision made, and the time-out charged to the referee.

#### ART. 2
Electronic devices shall not be used for any review of a referee's decision.

#### ART. 3
Decisions based on the judgment of the referee(s) are final and not subject to review.

### PENALTY:
If the referee's decision prevails, the team requesting the conference shall be charged a time-out. If the team has already used its allotted time-outs, a loss of rally/point shall be awarded to the opponent.
