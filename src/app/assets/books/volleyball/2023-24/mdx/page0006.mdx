2024-25 Points of Emphasis Ball Handling Volleyball is a rebound sport and players are able to use any body part to play the ball. The official’s judgment on the legality of each contact continues to be a controversial topic. The goal for players is to master ball control; for officials, it is a goal to maintain a consistent level of ball handling from set to set and from match to match. Coaches play a role in the consistency equation with their methods of training, the expectations placed on their play- ers, and the desired level of allowance by the officials. The spectators are influenced by their coaches’ reactions, the spin of the ball, and their personal opinions, while the officials need to remain neutral to maintain fairness for both teams. It was stated in a previous NFHS Volleyball Points of Emphasis that volleyball’s goal was to increase the continuation of play when judging second ball contacts that are directed to a teammate. A player in a good position must play the ball without discernible double contact. Less severe judgment is applied to a contact by a player who makes a challenging or spec- tacular play while maintaining a legal play. Mishandled balls resulting in a blatant fault should still be called, regardless of the chal- lenging or spectacular nature of the play. Multiple contacts on the third ball must be whistled. With the increase of the players’ athleticism, officials are being challenged to judge the legality of the first contact, as well. The rule states that the ball is not allowed to come to rest or involve prolonged contact. The fact that the contact is an underhand action or done with an open hand is not an automatic call. Players are able to legally take a stab at the ball in an attempt to keep the ball alive as they pursue an errant contact from their teammate. A whistle should accompany prolonged contact. All skills should be judged similarly, according to the rules. Players are utilizing the setter dump effectively, while attackers are tipping the ball deeper into their opponent’s court and tipping with more power. Officials must determine where the ball contact was initiated in relation to the body and judge how long the player continued the action while in contact with the ball. Scoring Best Practices The score crew is an integral part of the officiating team. To facilitate a smooth match tempo, the scorer should: • Arrive at the site no less than 20 minutes before match time. • Complete the match information in the scorebook/scoresheet or an electronic scoring device. • Accept the team rosters and team lineups. • Record each team’s lineup in a scorebook/scoresheet or an electronic scoring device. • Secure each team’s lineup sheet by placing them face down on the score table. • Collaborate with the second referee to ensure that each team’s lineup is correct on the second referee's lineup card and verify that the teams are in correct starting positions on the court prior to each set. • The scorer should establish a routine with the assistant scorer who serves as a spotter and communicates the numbers of the incoming/outgoing substitutions and replacements. • The assistant scorer tracks each libero replacement and each substitution. • After the substitution information has been submitted, the scorer should indicate read- iness to the second referee.
