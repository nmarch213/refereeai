Rule 7-1 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 34 written lineup listing the uniform numbers for the six starting players in the proper serving order. Only one libero may be designated per set and shall be designated on the lineup sheet prior to each set. b. Thereafter, the written lineup shall not be changed except between sets of a match (no later than one minute remaining in the timed interval or inter- mission when used), for a legal substitution prior to the start of the set, or to replace a starting player who is injured/ill prior to the start of the set. c. One of the six starting players on the lineup sheet or the libero must be des- ignated as the playing captain by placing a "C" next to the player's number. ART. 3 . . . The written rosters and current lineups shall remain at the officials' table throughout each set. ART. 4 . . . No later than one minute remaining in the timed interval, or inter- mission when used, following each set, a coach from each team shall submit a written, accurate numeric lineup in proper serving order to the second referee. a. If a team submits its lineup and lists a number that no team member is wearing, the team shall: 1. Legally substitute a player with a legal number into that position. The team is charged with a substitution. 2. Change the incorrect libero number to the legal libero number (no pen- alty is assessed). b. If a lineup is submitted with a player's number duplicated in more than one starting position (including the libero), the error shall be corrected by revising the submitted lineup in one of two ways to ensure six unique, legal player numbers to start the set. 1. Change the listed libero with the duplicate number to a different legal number. 2. Use a substitution to change the starting player to a different legal num- ber into that position. PENALTIES: 1. Failure to submit to the second referee no later than two minutes prior to the end of timed prematch warmup, a written, accurate numeric lineup [except as addressed in items (a) and (b) above, 7-1-4] results in an unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card) assessed at the start of that set. If the lineup has not been submitted by the end of the timed prematch warmup, a subsequent unnecessary delay (administrative red card) shall be assessed to the offending team at the start of that set, resulting in a loss of rally/point awarded to the opponent. 2. Failure to submit a complete and written accurate numeric lineup [except as addressed in items (a) and (b) above, 7-1-4] to the second referee no later than one minute remaining in the timed interval or intermission when used results in an unnecessary delay (administrative yellow card) assessed at the start of the next set. If the lineup has not been submitted by the end of the timed interval or intermission when used, a subsequent unnecessary delay (administrative red card) shall be assessed to the offending team at the start of the next set, resulting in a loss of rally/point awarded to the opponent.
