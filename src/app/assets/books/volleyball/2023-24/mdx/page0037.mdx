Page 35 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Rule 8-1 r Rule 8 The Serve SECTION 1 DEFINITION ART. 1 . . . A serve is contact with the ball to initiate play. The server shall hit the ball with one hand, fist or arm while the ball is held, or after it is released by the server. The ball shall be contacted within five seconds after the first referee's signal to serve. A serve contacting and crossing the net shall remain in play pro- vided the ball is entirely within the net antennas. ART. 2 . . . The server shall serve from within the serving area (2-1-6) and shall not touch the end line or the floor outside the lines marking the width of the serving area at the instant the ball is contacted for the serve. The server's body may be in the air over or beyond the serving area boundary lines, having left the floor from within the serving area. ART. 3 . . . A team's term of service begins when a player assumes the right back position as the server and ends when a loss of rally is awarded. ART. 4 . . . For teams with fewer than six players, each time a vacant position rotates to serve in the right back position, a loss of rally/point is awarded to the opponent. ART. 5 . . . A player's term of service begins when the player assumes the right back position as the server and ends when a loss of rally is awarded or a substi- tution for the player is made prior to the end of the team's term of service. Each player may have only one re-serve during a team's term of service. ART. 6 . . . A re-serve shall be called when the server releases the ball for ser- vice, then catches it or it drops to the floor. The first referee shall cancel the serve and direct a second and last attempt at serve. The server is allowed a new five seconds for the re-serve. A tossed ball that contacts a backboard or its supports hanging in a vertical position over the serving area is an illegal serve and not eligible for a re-serve. (Signal 13) A re-serve is considered to be a part of a single attempt to serve. Therefore, af- ter the first referee's signal for service, no requests, e.g., time-out, service order, lineup, substitution, libero replacement, etc., may be recognized until after the ball has been served. SECTION 2 GENERAL ART. 1 . . . The first server of the set is the right back position. Thereafter, when a team is awarded a loss of rally, the player in the right front position rotates to the serving area. ART. 2 . . . A team continues serving until it loses the rally or the set ends.
