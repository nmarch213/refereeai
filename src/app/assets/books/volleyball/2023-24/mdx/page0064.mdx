Re- cord the number of the player that must be the same number of the player as the number before the "L" (i.e., 23 L 23). 6. When the libero is replaced (again, by the same player), the number of the player is recorded next on the line. 7. If a libero in the set assumes the serving position, record the "L" for the player being replaced and record the number of the player who was last replaced by the libero on the tracking sheet. 8. The libero tracker also records all substitutions. When a player (not a libero) is sub- stituted out of the set, the player's number is crossed off and the player's number entering the set is written on the line. 9. There are unlimited libero replacements but only 18 substitutions per set. NOTE: A different libero can be designated for each set, but the designation must be made on the lineup sheet when it is submitted to the official scorer before the set.
