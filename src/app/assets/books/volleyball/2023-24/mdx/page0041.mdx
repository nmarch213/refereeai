Page 39 2024- 25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Rule 9-5 c. A "joust" occurs when two opponents cause the ball to come to rest above the net through simultaneous contact. A "joust" is not a fault, and play con- tinues as if the contact was instantaneous. d. When opposing players contact the ball at the same instant, the player on the opposite side of the net from which the ball falls shall be considered the player to have touched the ball last. The other player may participate in the next play and the simultaneous contact shall not count as a hit. ART. 7 . . . Successive contacts of the ball are two or more separate attempts to play the ball by one player with no interrupting contact by a different player between the two plays. A player shall not have successive contacts of the ball unless there is: a. Simultaneous contact by teammates; b. Simultaneous contact by opposing players; c. Successive contacts by a player whose first contact is a block; then the second contact shall count as the first hit by the player's team. ART. 8 . . . Multiple contacts are more than one contact by a player during one attempt to play the ball. Multiple contacts are permitted only: a. When the first ball over the net rebounds from one part of the player's body to one or more other parts in one attempt to block; b. On any first team hit, whether or not the ball is touched by the block. PENALTIES: 1. Loss of rally/point is awarded to the opponent when a team has more than three hits. 2. Loss of rally/point is awarded to the opponent when there is any illegal con- tact, illegal successive contacts and/or illegal multiple contacts of the ball. SECTION 5 PLAYER ACTIONS ART. 1 . . .
