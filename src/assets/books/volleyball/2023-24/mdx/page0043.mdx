A player shall not contact a ball which is completely on the oppo- nent's side of the net unless the contact is a legal block. ART. 4 . . . Blocking a ball which is entirely on the opponent's side of the net is permitted when the opposing team has had an opportunity to complete its attack. The attack is considered complete when the: a. Attacking team has completed its three allowable hits; b. Attacking team has had the opportunity to complete the attack or, in the referee's judgment, directs the ball toward the opponent's court; c.

A net fault occurs while the ball is in play and: a. A player contacts any part of the net including net cables or net antennas.
