Rule 5-1 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 22 r Rule 5 Officials: Responsibilities and Positions SECTION 1 AUTHORIZED OFFICIALS ART. 1 . . . The match is administered by the first referee and the second ref- eree. Assistant officials include scorer, libero tracker, timer and line judges. All authorized officials shall be secured by the host school. NOTE: Line judges, unless determined otherwise by state association policy, shall be provided by the host school. ART. 2 . . . The first referee and second referee shall have the authority to make decisions about infractions of the rules committed. The use of replay, any monitoring or electronic device by the referees to make decisions related to the set is prohibited. ART. 3 . . . Jurisdiction of the referees begins upon their arrival on the floor and extends through the second referee's verification of the final score of the match. The referees retain clerical authority over the contest through the completion of any reports, including those imposing disqualifications, that are responsive to actions occurring while the referees had jurisdiction. State associations may in- tercede in the event of unusual incidents that occur before, during or after the referees' jurisdiction has ended or in the event that a contest is terminated prior to the conclusion of regulation play. ART. 4 . . . There shall be no exchange of duties by the first referee and second referee during a match except when an official is unable to continue. SECTION 2 OFFICIALS HAND SIGNALS MECHANICS NOTE: This section serves as guidance to the referees' mechanics and shall not be consid- ered as a game-playing rule and subject to any review under Rules 11-3-1, 11-3-2, 11-3-3. ART. 1 . . . After a referee whistles to signal the end of the rally, that referee indicates the decision with the official hand signals. a. If the fault is whistled by the first referee, the first referee indicates the result of the play (point or replay) followed by the nature of the fault. The second referee mirrors the first referee's signals. EXCEPTION: The second referee does not mirror the signal for a net serve. b. If a fault is whistled by the second referee, the second referee will indicate the nature of the fault and the player committing the net fault. The first referee, if in agreement, will then indicate the result of the play (point or replay), followed by the player committing the net fault; the second referee will mirror the signal of point or replay.
