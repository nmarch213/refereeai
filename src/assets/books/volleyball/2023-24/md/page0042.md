## Rule 9-5

### 2024-25 NFHS Volleyball Rules Page 40

1. **Overhand pass** – two-hand finger action directing the ball over the net.
2. **Block** – the action of a player(s) close to the net that deflects the ball coming from the opponent by reaching higher than the top of the net at the moment of contact. A block may involve wrist action provided there is no prolonged contact.

   - **Block attempt** – the action of blocking without touching the ball. An attempt to block does not constitute a block.
   - **Completed block** – when the ball is touched by a blocker. Only front-row players are permitted to complete a block.
   - **Collective block** – a block executed by more than one blocker in close proximity. It is completed when one of the players touches the ball. It is a blocking fault if a back-row player or libero participates in a completed collective block.

   > **NOTE:** If a player near the net is reaching above the height of the net and opponents legally cause the ball to contact that player, the player is considered to be a blocker. A back-row player attempting to play a ball in the space directly above the net is considered an illegal blocker if the ball is attacked or blocked by an opponent into the back-row player while the player is reaching above the height of the net (including simultaneous contact).

3. **ART. 2** . . . Front-row players may contact the ball from any position inside or outside the court provided the ball has not completely crossed the vertical plane of the net or the net extended. ([Rule 9-5-7](#rule-9-5-7), [Rule 9-5-8](#rule-9-5-8))

4. **ART. 3** . . . Back-row players, while positioned behind the attack line, may contact the ball from any position inside or outside the court above or below the top of the net.

5. **ART. 4** . . . A back-row player (on or in front of the attack line), cannot contact the ball completely above the height of the net and complete an attack.

6. **ART. 5** . . . A back-row player shall not:

   - a. Participate in a completed block;
   - b. Attack a ball which is completely above the height of the net while positioned:
     1. On or in front of the attack line or its out-of-bounds extension;
     2. In the air, having left the floor on or in front of the attack line or its out-of-bounds extension.

   > **NOTE:** An illegal back-row attack shall not be called until the ball has completely crossed the net or is contacted by the opponent. ([Rule 9-4-4](#rule-9-4-4))

7. **ART. 6** . . . A libero shall not:

   - a. Complete an attack from anywhere if, at the moment of contact, the ball is entirely above the height of the net;
   - b. Set the ball using overhand finger action while on or in front of the attack line extended, resulting in a completed attack above the height of the net;
   - c. Block or attempt to block;
   - d. Rotate to the front row.

8. **ART. 7** . . . A player may touch the floor across the center line with one or both feet/hands provided a part of the foot/feet or hand(s) remains on or above the center line. Contacting the floor across the center line with any other part of the body is illegal.
