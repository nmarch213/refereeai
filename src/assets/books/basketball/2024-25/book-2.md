## 1. General Rules

### 1.1 Definitions

> **Official**: An individual responsible for enforcing the rules of the game.

### 1.2 Responsibilities of Officials

- Ensure the game is played according to the rules. See [2. Game Regulations](#2-game-regulations).
- Maintain control of the game.
- Make decisions on fouls, violations, and other game-related issues. See [3. Fouls and Violations](#3-fouls-and-violations).
- Check and approve the score at the end of each half.
- Inform each team and the table officials of the overtime procedures when the score is tied at the end of regulation time.
- Notify the head coach and request the timer to begin the replacement interval, and then notify the player on a disqualification.
- Immediately remove a player from the game who exhibits signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion. See [3.3 Flagrant Fouls](#33-flagrant-fouls) for more on player safety.

### 1.3 Intent and Purpose of the Rules

> The restrictions which the rules place upon the players are intended to create a balance of play; to provide equal opportunity between the offense and the defense; to provide equal opportunity between the small player and tall player; to provide reasonable risk minimization; to create an atmosphere of sporting behavior and fair play; and to emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom of action of individual or team play on either offense or defense. Therefore, it is important to know the intent and purpose of a rule so that it may be intelligently applied in each play situation. A player or a team should not be permitted an advantage which is not intended by a rule. Neither should play be permitted to develop which may lead to placing a player at a disadvantage not intended by a rule. It is the policy of the NFHS Basketball Rules Committee that there be no deviation from the rules unless experimental approval has been granted by the NFHS liaison to the rules committee.

### 1.4 Court Boundaries

> If, on an unofficial court, there is less than 3 feet of unobstructed space outside any sideline or end line, a narrow broken line shall be marked on the court parallel with and 3 feet inside that boundary. This restraining line becomes the boundary line during a throw-in on that side or end, as in [Rule 4.6](#46-throw-in-spot-regulations). It continues to be the boundary until the ball crosses the line.

### 1.5 Center Restraining Circle and Division Line

- A restraining circle shall be drawn at the center of the court with a radius of 6 feet measured to the outside edge. The edge of the circle shall be designated with a minimum of a ¼-inch-wide single line but no wider than 2 inches. See [6.1 General Court Specifications](#61-general-court-specifications), No. 3 if the use of contrasting colored-floor areas instead of a line is desirable. Spaces for non-jumpers around the center circle are 36 inches deep.
- A division line 2 inches wide shall divide the court into two equal parts. If the court is less than 74 feet long, it should be divided by two lines, each parallel to and 40 feet from the farther end line.
- Shadow-bordered lines are permissible. A shadow line is a line that designates the required width by use of border or outline lines at least ¼-inch wide, which shall lie within the required width. Border lines that are the natural color of the court are permissible. The area within these lines need not be one color, but the continuous outline shall be clearly visible to the officials. If the floor has a logo in the center of the court, that logo should not distract from the visibility of the division line or center circle.

### 1.6 Three-Point Line

- A three-point line, 2 inches wide in the form of a semicircle, shall be drawn at each end of the court as shown in [Diagram 1](#10-basketball-court-diagram). The semicircle has a radius of 19 feet 9 inches from a point in the middle of the free-throw lane directly below the center of the basket to the outside edge of the line. The semicircle shall be extended with a 2-inch wide line perpendicular to the end line, the length of which shall be 63 inches from the inside edge of the end line.
- The three-point line shall be the same color as the free-throw lane boundary lines and free-throw semicircle.

### 1.7 Free-Throw Lane

- A free-throw lane, 12 feet wide measured to the outside of each lane boundary, and the semicircle with the free-throw line as a diameter, shall be marked at each end of the court with dimensions and markings as shown in [Diagram 1](#10-basketball-court-diagram). All lines designating the free-throw lane, but not lane-space marks, are part of the lane.
- The lane-space marks (2 inches by 8 inches) identify areas which extend 36 inches from the outer edge of the lane lines toward the sidelines. There are three lane spaces on each lane boundary line.

### 1.8 Free-Throw Line

> A free-throw line, 2 inches wide, shall be drawn across both semicircles, which have an outside radius of 6 feet as shown in [Diagram 1](#10-basketball-court-diagram). It shall be parallel to the end line and shall have its farthest edge 15 feet from the plane of the face of the backboard.

### 1.9 Backboards

- The backboards shall be the same size at both ends of the court. The backboard shall be one of three types:
  1. A rectangle 6 feet horizontally and 4 feet vertically.
  2. A rectangle 6 feet horizontally and 3½ feet vertically.
  3. A fan-shaped backboard, 54 inches wide and with dimensions as shown in [Diagram 2](#10-basketball-court-diagram).

> **NOTE**: The 6-foot horizontal and 3½-foot vertical dimensions are recommended for replacement backboards or new installations.

- Each of the backboards shall be of any rigid material. The front surface shall be flat and, unless it is transparent, it shall be white. Tinted glass backboards are prohibited.

- If the backboard is transparent, it shall be marked as follows: A rectangle shall be centered behind the ring and marked by a 2-inch white line. The rectangle shall have outside dimensions of 24 inches horizontally and 18 inches vertically. For the rectangular backboard, the top edge of the backboard shall be level with the ring. For the fan-shaped backboard, the baseline shall be omitted, and the two vertical lines shall be extended to the bottom of the backboard. The rectangular target in a bright orange or black color may be used on a non-transparent backboard. The border of the backboard shall be marked with a white line.

### 1.10 Backboard Support and Basket Specifications

> **ART. 1**: Any backboard support behind the backboard and at a height of less than 9 feet above the floor shall be padded on the bottom surface to a distance of 2 feet from the face of the backboard. All portable backstops shall have the bases padded to a height of 7 feet on the court-side surface.

> **ART. 2**: Clearances – All support systems should be at least 8 feet behind the plane of the backboard face and at a height of 7 feet or more above the floor.

> **ART. 3**: Any backboard support, all of which is not directly behind the backboard, should be at least 6 inches behind it if the support extends above the top and at least 2 feet behind it if the support extends beyond the side. Any overhead backboard support structure which shall be forward-braced due to space limitations, architectural or structural restraints, shall meet the following requirements: A front, diagonal-brace system shall be located above a line extending upward and into the playing court at a maximum 45-degree angle from a point on a vertical line located a minimum of 6 inches behind the front side of the backboard at a minimum height of 4 feet 6 inches above the basket ring.

> **ART. 4**: Warning on misuse of portable backstops – Manufacturers and administrators should be aware of an "extreme-caution" warning relative to the misuse of portable backstops. A high degree of injury potential and a severe liability problem exists when players or spectators are allowed to hang, sit or stand on the basket ring or backboard. Administrators shall see that this practice is eliminated or that the portable units are lowered at the completion of the game. There is a high risk of severe injury, even death, if this practice is allowed to occur. A recommended warning or inscription such as "Danger – please do not get on the ring/backboard" is desirable.

### 1.11 Basket Ring Specifications

> **ART. 1**: The upper edge of the basket ring shall be 10 feet above the floor and parallel to it, equidistant from the vertical edges of the backboard. The nearest point of the inside edge of the ring shall be 6 inches from the plane of the face of the backboard.

> **ART. 2**: Positive-lock breakaway, flex breakaway, and fixed rings are legal. Breakaway basket rings shall have rebound characteristics similar to those of fixed rings. The pressure-release mechanism should ensure these characteristics, as well as protect both the ring and backboard.

> **ART. 3**: For those rings with a breakaway mechanism, the pressure-release mechanism shall be preset so that rings do not deflect more than ½ inch when subjected to a static load of 50 pounds and may be sealed or field adjustable. When released, the positive-lock breakaway ring shall not rotate more than 30 degrees below the original horizontal position. After release and with the load no longer applied, the ring shall return automatically and instantaneously to the original position.

> **NOTE**: It is recommended that schools have the basket rings tested for rules compliance.

### 1.12 Ball Specifications

> **ART. 1**: The ball shall meet the following specifications:

- a. Its solid color shall be Pantone Matching System (PMS) Orange 151, Red-Orange 173, or Brown 1535.
- b. It shall be spherical.
- c. It shall have a deeply-pebbled, granulated surface with horizontally shaped panels bonded tightly to the rubber carcass.
- d. The circumference shall be:
  1. Within a minimum of 29½ inches to a maximum of 30 inches for high school boys competition.
  2. Within a minimum of 28½ inches to a maximum of 29 inches for high school girls competition.
- e. The weight shall be:
  1. Within a minimum of 20 ounces to a maximum of 22 ounces for high school boys competition.
  2. Within a minimum of 18 ounces to a maximum of 20 ounces for high school girls competition.
- f. The black rubber rib separating the panels shall not exceed ¼ inch in width.
- g. The ball shall include the NFHS Authenticating Mark. The mark can be displayed in either format shown in [Diagram 3](#10-basketball-court-diagram). A current list of NFHS authenticated products can be found on the website, nfhs.org, under "Resources."

> **ART. 2**: The ball shall be inflated to an air pressure such that when it is dropped to the playing surface from a height of 6 feet, measured to the bottom of the ball, it shall rebound to a height, measured to the top of the ball, of not less than 49 inches when it strikes on its least resilient spot, nor more than 54 inches when it strikes on its most resilient spot. **EXCEPTION**: To be legal, the air pressure which will give the required reaction shall be stamped on it. The pressure for game use shall make the ball bounce legally.

> **ART. 3**: The home team shall provide a ball which meets the specifications. The referee shall be the sole judge of the legality of the ball and may select a ball provided by the visiting team.

### 1.13 Team Bench Locations, Coaching Box, Time-Out Area

> **ART. 1**: The location of each team's bench shall be designated by game management. It is recommended that the benches for team members and coaches of both teams be placed along that side of the court on which the scorer's and timer's table is located.

> **ART. 2**: The coaching box shall be outlined outside the side of the court on which the scorer's and timer's table and team benches are located. The area shall be bounded by a line drawn 28 feet from the end line towards the division line. A line, perpendicular to the 28-foot line and placed at each end, with a minimum length of 2 feet, shall be extended toward the team bench so that the coaching box boundary is evident. These lines shall be located off the court and be 2 inches wide. The same directions should be followed for the other side of the scorer's and timer's table. **NOTE**: State associations may alter the length and placement of the 28-foot (maximum) coaching box.

> **ART. 3**: The time-out area shall be the area inside an imaginary rectangle formed by the boundaries of the sideline (including the bench), end line, and an imaginary line extended from the free-throw lane line nearest the bench area meeting an imaginary line extended from the coaching-box line.

### 1.14 Obstructions – Distance

> **ART. 1**: The distance from the playing area to any obstruction shall be a minimum of 3 feet. This includes any permanent or temporary structures, including but not limited to benches, tables, and spectator areas.

## 2. Game Regulations

### 2.1 Game Duration

- A standard game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. **EXCEPTION**: Playing time for teams of high school age shall be four quarters of eight minutes each with intermissions of one minute after the first and third quarters, and 10 minutes between halves. The halftime intermission may be extended to a maximum of 15 minutes for special activities, provided home management has properly notified the visiting team prior to the start of the game. See [4.10 End-of-Game Protocols](#410-end-of-game-protocols) for procedures related to overtime.

### 2.2 Timeouts

- Each team is allowed a maximum of 7 timeouts per game. See [4.3 Game Management](#43-game-management).
- Timeouts can be called during stoppages in play. Refer to [4. New Content](#4-new-content) for more on game management.
  > **ART. 5**: A time-out shall not be granted until after the ball has become live to start the game. The additional 60-second time-out provided for each extra period(s) shall not be granted until after the ball has become live to start the extra period(s).
  >
  > **ART. 6**: Time-outs in excess of the allotted number may be requested and shall be granted during regulation playing time or any extra period at the expense of a technical foul for each, as in [Rule 10-2-3](#).
  >

  >
  > **ART. 8**: Time-outs simultaneously requested by opposing teams or those requested to keep players in the game that were directed to leave for injury/blood, as in [Rules 3-3-6](#) and [3-3-7](#) NOTES, shall be granted, charged to the respective team and administered concurrently. When one team is charged with a 30-second time-out and the other a 60-second time-out, the duration shall be 60 seconds.

### 2.3 Game Ball Specifications

- The official game ball must be made of leather or synthetic material.
- The circumference of the ball should be 29.5 inches for men's games and 28.5 inches for women's games. See [1.12 Ball Specifications](#112-ball-specifications) for detailed specifications.

### 2.4 Shot Clock Operator

> **NOTE**: Requires the shot clock operator to sit at the scorer’s and timer’s table if using a shot clock. This change was made due to the increased use of large video boards that allow timers to utilize tablets to control the clock from anywhere in the facility. Officials need to have easy access to the scorer, timer, and the shot clock operator during contests. See [4.4 Instant Replay](#44-instant-replay) for implications on game management.

### 2.5 Scorer Location

> An "X" 12 inches long and 2 inches wide shall be placed on the floor out of bounds directly in front of the official scorer to help substitutes with the proper location. (See [Diagram 1](#10-basketball-court-diagram)).

### 2.6 Music/Sound Effects/Artificial Noisemakers

> The playing of music/sound effects shall only be permitted during pregame, time-outs, intermission, and post-game. The use of artificial noisemakers shall be prohibited. The announcer shall be prohibited from making announcements during the game, such as "two minutes to go."

### 2.7 Electronic Devices

> The use of electronic devices is permitted during the game.

### 2.8 Non-Playing Personnel

> Non-playing personnel, e.g., spirit participants, media, shall remain outside of the playing area during a 30-second time-out. Non-playing personnel shall be located outside the free-throw lane lines extended toward the sidelines throughout the game.

### 2.9 Officials' Jurisdiction

> **ART. 1**: The officials' jurisdiction, prior to the game, begins when they arrive on the floor. The officials' arrival on the floor shall be at least 15 minutes before the scheduled starting time of the game.

> **ART. 2**: The officials' jurisdiction extends through periods when the game may be momentarily stopped for any reason.

> **ART. 3**: The jurisdiction of the officials is terminated and the final score has been approved when all officials leave the visual confines of the playing area.

> **NOTE**: The officials retain clerical authority over the contest through the completion of any reports, including those imposing disqualifications, which are responsive to actions occurring while the officials had jurisdiction. State associations may intercede in the event of unusual incidents that occur before, during, or after the officials' jurisdiction has ended or in the event that a contest is terminated prior to the conclusion of regulation play.

### 2.10 Scorer's Duties

> The scorer shall:
>
> **ART. 1**: Keep a record of the names and numbers of players who are to start the game and of all substitutes who enter the game.
>
> **NOTE**: It is recommended the team members' numbers be entered into the scorebook in numerical order.
>
> **ART. 2**: Notify the nearer official when there is an infraction of the rules pertaining to submission of the roster, substitutions, or numbers of players.
>
> **ART. 3**: Signal the officials by using the game horn or a sounding device unlike that used by the referee and umpire(s). This may be used immediately if, or as soon as, the ball is dead or is in control of the offending team.
>
> **ART. 4**: Record the field goals made, the free throws made and missed, and keep a running summary of the points scored.
>
> **ART. 5**: Record warnings for head coach/bench personnel misconduct as well as the personal and technical fouls reported on each player and notify an official immediately when the fifth foul (personal and technical) is charged to any player, the second technical foul is charged to any team member, bench personnel, or directly to the head coach, or the third technical foul is charged to the head coach.
>
> **NOTE**: The procedure if a player who has committed a fifth foul continues to play because the scorer has failed to notify the official is as follows: As soon as the scorer discovers the irregularity, the game horn should be sounded after, or as soon as, the ball is in control of the offending team or is dead. The disqualified player shall be removed immediately. Any points which may have been scored while such player was illegally in the game are counted. If other aspects of the error are correctable, the procedure to be followed is included among the duties of the officials.

### 2.11 Timer's Duties

> The timer shall:
>
> **ART. 1**: Note when each half is to start and shall notify the referee more than three minutes before this time so the referee may notify the teams, or cause them to be notified, at least three minutes before the half is to start.
>
> **ART. 2**: Signal the scorer three minutes before starting time.
>
> **ART. 3**: Be provided with a clock to be used for timing quarters, extra periods and intermissions, and a stopwatch for timing time-outs. The clock shall be operated by the official timer. The clock and a stopwatch shall be placed so that they may be seen by the timer. The clock shall be started or stopped as prescribed in [Rules 5-8](#611-time-outs-and-stopping-play) and [5-9](#611-time-outs-and-stopping-play).
>
> **ART. 4**: Sound a warning signal 15 seconds before the expiration of an intermission or a time-out, immediately after which the players shall prepare to resume play, and signal again at the end of the intermission or time-out.
>
> **ART. 5**: Sound a warning signal to announce 15 seconds (maximum) permitted for replacing a disqualified or injured player, or for a player directed to leave the game and signal again at the end of the interval.

> **ART. 6**: Stop the clock at the expiration of time for each quarter or extra period, and when an official signals time-out, as in [Rule 5-8](#611-time-outs-and-stopping-play). For an intermission or a charged time-out, start the stopwatch and signal the referee as outlined in Article 4.

> **ART. 7**: Indicate by signal the expiration of playing time in each quarter or extra period. If a red/LED light is used, the light is the official expiration of playing time.

> **SECTION 13 TIMER'S EQUIPMENT**: If the red/LED light fails to illuminate and the timer's signal fails to sound, or is not recognized by the officials, the timer shall go onto the court or use other means to immediately notify the nearest official. If in the meantime, a goal has been made or a foul has occurred, the referee shall consult the timer:
>
> > **ART. 1**: If table officials agree that time expired before the ball was in flight, the goal shall not count.
> > **ART. 2**: If table officials agree that the quarter or extra period ended, as in [Rule 5-6-2](#611-time-outs-and-stopping-play), before the foul occurred, the foul shall be disregarded, unless it was intentional or flagrant.
> > **ART. 3**: If table officials disagree, the goal shall count and/or the foul shall be penalized, unless the referee has knowledge which alters such ruling.

> **SECTION 14 SHOT CLOCK**: By state association adoption, member state associations may establish a shot clock in which the team in control shall attempt a try for field goal within 35 seconds after gaining team control.
>
> **ART. 1**: This shall be regulated by a visible shot clock.
> **ART. 2**: The tap or try for field goal shall leave the shooter's hand before the expiration of time and subsequently strike the basket ring or enter the basket before or after the shot clock period has expired. (See the Guidelines for Establishing a Shot Clock on page 74.)

### 2.12 Restarting the Clock

> **ART. 1**: After time has been out, the clock shall be started when the official signals the clock to start. If the official neglects to signal, the timer is authorized to start the clock as per rule, unless an official specifically signals continued time-out.
>
> **ART. 2**: If play is started or resumed by a jump ball, the clock shall be started when the tossed ball is legally touched.
>
> **ART. 3**: If a free throw is not successful and the ball is to remain live, the clock shall be started when the ball touches or is touched by a player on the court.
>
> **ART. 4**: If play is resumed by a throw-in, the clock shall be started when the ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court after it is released by the thrower.

### 2.13 Timing Mistakes

> **ART. 1**: The referee may correct an obvious mistake by the timer to start or stop the clock properly only when the referee has definite information relative to the time involved. The exact time observed by the official may be placed on the clock.
>
> **ART. 2**: If the referee determines the clock malfunctioned or was not started/stopped properly, or if the clock did not run, an official's count or other official information may be used to make a correction.

### 2.14 Charged Time-Outs

> **ART. 1**: Three 60-second and two 30-second time-outs may be charged to each team during a regulation game. Each team is entitled to one additional 60-second time-out during each extra period. Unused time-outs accumulate and may be used at any time.
>
> **NOTE**: State associations may determine the number of electronic media time-outs for games which are transmitted and may reduce the number of charged time-outs.
>
> **ART. 2**: A single 60-second time-out charged to a team shall not exceed one minute and shall be conducted within the confines of the time-out area. A warning signal for the teams to prepare to resume play is sounded with 15 seconds remaining. Such a time-out shall not be reduced in length unless both teams are ready to play before the time-out is over.
>
> **ART. 3**: A single 30-second charged time-out shall not exceed 30 seconds and players shall remain standing within the time-out area. A warning signal for teams to prepare to resume play is sounded with 15 seconds remaining. No on-court entertainment shall occur during this time.
>
> **ART. 4**: Only one 60-second time-out is charged (or one 30-second time-out, if that is the only type of time-out remaining) in Rule 5-8-4 regardless of the amount of time consumed when no correction is made.
>
> **EXCEPTION**: No time-out is charged:
>
> - a. If, in Rule 5-8-3, the player's request results from displaced eyeglasses or lens.
> - b. If, in Rule 5-8-4, the error or mistake is prevented or rectified.

### 2.15 Shot Clock Regulations

> **SHOT CLOCK – STATE ASSOCIATION ADOPTION**: In accordance with Rule 2-14, each state association may adopt a procedure by which it implements a 35-second shot clock effective with the 2023-24 season. The following recommended guidelines are for those states choosing to adopt the shot clock.

> **SHOT CLOCK DISPLAYS**:
>
> 1. A shot clock is one of two official visible timepieces – one at each end of the court.
> 2. Shot clocks should be recessed and mounted on the backboard supports behind each backboard.
> 3. An alternate timing device or procedure shall be available when a visible shot clock malfunctions.
> 4. LED lights located around the shot clock may be used, but the lights shall only be activated for a shot clock violation.
> 5. Nothing shall be attached to the shot clock mounting mechanisms that affects the visibility of the shot clock.

> **GAME AND TABLE OFFICIALS**: A shot clock operator will be located at the scorer’s and timer’s table. It is recommended that the timer and shot clock operator be seated next to each other.

> **OFFICIALS' GENERAL DUTIES**:
>
> 1. Use the shot clock to administer the 10-second backcourt count (9-8). The 10-second count shall begin when the ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court, in the backcourt on a throw-in or on player control on a rebound or jump ball.

> **ART. 3**: It is legal to hold the hands and arms in front of the face or body for protection and to absorb force from an imminent charge by an opponent. This same protective use of the arms and hands occurs when a player who has set a screen outside the opponent's visual field is about to be run into by the player being screened. The action, however, should be a recoil action rather than a pushing action.
>
> **ART. 4**: It is not legal to use hands and arms or hips and shoulders to force through a screen or to hold the screener and then to push the screener aside in order to maintain a guarding position relative to the opponent.
>
> **ART. 5**: It is not legal to use hands on an opponent which in any way inhibits the freedom of movement of the opponent or acts as an aid to a player in starting or stopping.
>
> **ART. 6**: It is not legal to extend the arms fully or partially in a position other than vertical so that the freedom of movement of an opponent is hindered when contact with the arms occurs. The extension of the elbows when the hands are on the hips or when the hands are held near the chest or when the arms are held more or less horizontally are examples of the illegal positions used.
>
> **ART. 7**: It is not legal to use the hand and/or forearm to prevent an opponent from attacking the ball during a dribble or when throwing for goal.
>
> **ART. 8**: It is not legal to swing arms and elbows excessively. This occurs when:
>
> - a. Arms and elbows are swung about while using the shoulders as pivots, and the speed of the extended arms and elbows is in excess of the rest of the body as it rotates on the hips or on the pivot foot.
> - b. The aggressiveness with which the arms and elbows are swung could cause injury to another player if contacted. Using this description as a basis, an official will promptly and unhesitatingly rule such action with arms and elbows a violation.
>
> **ART. 9**: It is not legal to lock arms or grasp a teammate(s) in an effort to restrict the movement of an opponent.

### 3.17 Held Ball

> **SECTION 25 HELD BALL**: A held ball occurs when:
>
> - **ART. 1**: Opponents have their hands so firmly on the ball that control cannot be obtained without undue roughness.
> - **ART. 2**: An opponent places a hand(s) on the ball and prevents an airborne player from throwing the ball or releasing it on a try or tap for field goal.

### 3.18 Holding

> **SECTION 26 HOLDING**: Holding is illegal personal contact with an opponent which interferes with the opponent's freedom of movement.

### 3.19 Incidental Contact

> **SECTION 27 INCIDENTAL CONTACT**: Incidental contact is contact with an opponent which is permitted and which does not constitute a foul.
>
> - **ART. 1**: The mere fact that contact occurs does not constitute a foul. When 10 players are moving rapidly in a limited area, some contact is certain to occur.
> - **ART. 2**: Contact, which may result when opponents are in equally favorable positions to perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal, even though the contact may be severe.
> - **ART. 3**: Contact, which does not hinder the opponent from participating in normal defensive or offensive movements, should be considered incidental.
> - **ART. 4**: A player who is screened within the player's visual field is expected to avoid contact with the screener by stopping or going around the screener. In cases of screens outside the visual field, the opponent may make inadvertent contact with the screener, and such contact is to be ruled incidental contact, provided the screener is not displaced if the screener has the ball.
> - **ART. 5**: If a player approaches an opponent from behind or from a position from which the player has no reasonable chance to play the ball without making contact, the responsibility is on the player in the unfavorable position.

### 3.20 Jump Ball

> **SECTION 28 JUMP BALL**:
>
> - **ART. 1**: A jump ball is a method of putting the ball into play to start the game and each extra period by tossing it up between two opponents in the center restraining circle, or as in Rule 7-3 before the alternating-possession procedure has been established.
> - **ART. 2**: The jump ball begins when the ball leaves the official's hand(s) and ends when the touched ball contacts a nonjumper, an official or the floor.

> - **ART. 2**: Type 2: Basket interference or goaltending by a player at the opponent's basket.
> - **ART. 3**: Type 3: Free-throw violations other than those involving basket interference or goaltending.
