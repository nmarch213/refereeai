## Facility Conditions

Gymnasium conditions have a great influence in the administration of a game. A slippery floor or one with a layer of accumulated dust is a source of trouble and dissatisfaction. An inadequately lighted court detracts from efficiency and has a depressing effect on everyone. Unclean backboards, basket rings that are not level, or basket nets that are either ragged or tight so as to cause delays are conditions that contribute to an unsatisfactory event. For many school patrons, the athletic contest provides the only opportunity for seeing the school in action. Their impression ought to be one of good organization and businesslike efficiency.

### D. Time Management

Starting a game later than scheduled and having unduly long athletic contests are evidence of a lack of administrative responsibility. They are an imposition on the visiting team, the students, the fans, and the officials.

### E. Choosing Personnel

Properly administering a contest is an exacting task. Many coworkers are involved. Each member of this team of student managers and faculty assistants has delegated responsibilities. It is important to conduct practice for this team in the fundamentals of good management. A team that demonstrates pride in its work will provide fewer "athletic headaches" because the school provides conditions that keep players and followers looking for enjoyable occurrences and clear of passing judgment on decisions and playing strategy.

<!-- Section: Selection of Scorer and Timer -->

## Selection of Scorer and Timer

### A. Adults

A high school student or one of last year's graduates will have the interest and enthusiasm but may lack poise, impartiality, and judgment.

### B. Experience

Choose someone who has had some playing, coaching, or officiating experience.

### C. Faculty

If faculty members are available for these jobs, they usually do the best work, although it is not a guarantee.

### D. Reliable

Choose people who can and will be present at every home game. It may be an honor to act as timer or scorer, but it's not an honor that should be passed around with each game.

### E. Good Judgment

Above all, choose someone with plenty of poise, good judgment, a sense of impartiality, and one who you are sure will be able to forget the score and concentrate instead on the job.

<!-- Section: Training the Table Officials -->

## Training the Table Officials

### A. Preseason

Before the opening of the season, provide the table officials with a rules book, case book, and other basketball rules material available through the state office. This should be done regardless of the number of years they have served in this capacity. There are frequent rules changes that affect the tasks of these officials. Call attention to those sections of the rules that directly or indirectly refer to their duties. Insist on a careful study of the "Instructions to the Scorer" and "Instructions to the Timer."

### B. Rules Meetings

Suggest that your timer and scorer attend one of the state-sponsored rules interpretation meetings and, if possible, an occasional meeting of a local officials' group.

### C. Practice Games

Before the first game, arrange for several intrasquad scrimmages conducted under actual game conditions with your timer and scorer at the bench. Plan to set up unusual situations involving timing and scoring. Check carefully on the work done in these scrimmages and make comments and provide constructive feedback.

### D. Observe and Evaluate

Observe the work of these officials during games and provide suggestions for improvement.

### E. Crew Respect

See that your timer and scorer are accorded the same courtesy and respect as that due the floor officials. Their work is important, and it should be done with dignity and pride in good performance.
