### 5. Start the shot clock when:

1. The ball touches, or is legally touched by, a player on the court;
2. A team gains initial control after a jump ball or unsuccessful try for goal;
3. There is a change in team control.

### 6. Stop the timing device and reset to full amount:

1. When there is a change in team control and the ball remains live or after a score by the opponent.
   > **NOTE:** The mere touching of the ball by an opponent does not start a new shot clock period when the same team remains in control of the ball.
2. When any of the following occurs:
   - A single personal foul;
   - A single technical foul;
   - During team control, a defensive player causes a held ball, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the defensive team;
   - A try for goal strikes the ring or flange and then control is gained by either team;
   - A violation;
   - A held ball or any other situation where the alternating-possession arrow is used to determine team possession and the alternating-possession arrow favors the defense for the throw-in;
   - After the ball goes out of bounds and was last touched simultaneously by two opponents, both of whom are either inbounds or out of bounds or when there is doubt as to who last touched the ball and the possession arrow favors the defensive team;
   - There is an inadvertent whistle and there was no player or team control at the time of the whistle;

### 7. Stop the timing device and continue time without a reset when play is stopped under the following circumstances:

1. The ball is deflected out of bounds by a defensive player;
2. A player is injured or loses a contact lens;
3. A charged time-out has concluded;
4. During team control as defined in [Rule 4-12-1](#rule-4-12-1), a defensive player causes a held ball, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the offensive team;
5. After any double personal or technical fouls or simultaneous personal or technical fouls when there is team control unless the penalty for the foul results in a change of possession;
6. After an inadvertent whistle when there is team control;
7. After a held ball occurs during a throw-in, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the team that made the throw-in;
8. When a held ball occurs after an unsuccessful try that does not contact the ring or flange, and the alternating-possession arrow favors the shooting team;
9. After the ball goes out of bounds and was last touched simultaneously by two opponents, both of whom are either inbounds or out of bounds or when there is doubt as to who last touched the ball and the alternating-possession arrow favors the offensive team;
   > **NOTE:** The offensive team, upon regaining possession of the ball for the throw-in, shall have the unexpired time on the shot clock to attempt a try.
