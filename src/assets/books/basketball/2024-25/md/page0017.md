### #rule-12-2

**ART. 2** . . . Positive-lock breakaway, flex breakaway and fixed rings are legal. Breakaway basket rings shall have rebound characteristics similar to those of fixed rings. The pressure-release mechanism should ensure these characteristics, as well as protect both the ring and backboard. The design of the ring and its construction should ensure player safety.

### #rule-12-3

**ART. 3** . . . For those rings with a breakaway mechanism, the pressure-release mechanism shall be preset so that rings do not deflect more than ½ inch when subjected to static load of 50 pounds and may be sealed or field adjustable. When released, the positive-lock breakaway ring shall not rotate more than 30 degrees below the original horizontal position. After release and with the load no longer applied, the ring shall return automatically and instantaneously to the original position.

> **NOTE:** It is recommended that schools have the basket rings tested for rules compliance.
