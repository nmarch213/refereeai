## Rule 10-7: Participation in a Fight

### 10-7 (2)

> Participate in the fight â€“ all participants are assessed flagrant fouls and disqualified. The head coach is assessed one indirect technical foul for each person leaving the bench and participating in the fight. If the number leaving the bench for each team is corresponding, no free throws are awarded, and the ball is put in play at the point of interruption. If the number leaving the bench for each team is unequal, two free throws are awarded to the offended team for each additional person leaving the bench, followed by a division line throw-in opposite the table.

**NOTE:** All fouls (except an indirect technical foul charged to the head coach) count toward the team's foul count in the half.
