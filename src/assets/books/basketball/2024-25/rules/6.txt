Rule 6 Live Ball and Dead Ball SECTION 1 LIVE BALL ART. 1 . . . The game and each extra period shall be started by a jump ball in the center restraining circle. After any subsequent dead ball, the only way to get the ball live is to resume play by a jump ball in the center restraining circle, by a throw-in or by a free throw. The dribble and traveling rules are not in effect in these situations. ART. 2 . . . The ball becomes live when: a. On a jump ball, the tossed ball leaves the official's hand(s). b. On a throw-in, it is at the disposal of the thrower. c. On a free throw, it is at the disposal of the free thrower. NOTE: Any rules statement is made on the assumption that no infraction is involved unless mentioned or implied. If such infraction occurs, the rule governing it is followed. For example, a game or extra period will not start with a jump ball if a foul occurs before the ball becomes live. SECTION 2 STARTING GAME/QUARTER/EXTRA PERIOD ART. 1 . . . The game, quarter and each extra period begins when the ball becomes live as specified in Rule 6-1-2 for a jump ball, throw-in or free throw. ART. 2 . . . To start the game and each extra period, the ball shall be put in play in the center restraining circle by a jump ball between any two opponents. ART. 3 . . . To start the second, third and fourth quarters, the ball shall be put in play by a throw-in under the alternating-possession procedure.

Teammates may not occupy adjacent positions around the center restraining circle if an opponent indicates a desire for one of these positions be- fore the official is ready to toss the ball. ART. 4 . . . The ball shall be tossed upward between the jumpers in a plane at right angles to the sidelines. The toss shall be to a height greater than either of them can jump so that it will drop between them. ART. 5 . . . Until the tossed ball is touched by one or both jumpers, nonjumpers shall not: a. Have either foot break the plane of the center restraining circle cylinder. b. Take a position in any occupied space. ART. 6 . . .

If the ball contacts the floor without being touched by at least one of the jumpers, the official shall toss it again. ART. 7 . . . Neither jumper shall: a. Touch the tossed ball before it reaches its highest point. b. Leave the center restraining circle until the ball has been touched. c. Catch the ball before the jump ball ends. d. Touch the ball more than twice. ART. 8 . . . The jump ball and the restrictions in Rule 6-3-7 end when the touched ball contacts one of the eight nonjumpers, an official or the floor. NOTE: During a jump ball, a jumper is not required to face the jumper's own basket, provided the jumper is in the proper half of the center restraining circle. The jumper is also not required to jump and attempt to touch the tossed ball. However, if neither jumper touches the ball it should be tossed again with both jumpers being ordered to jump and try to touch the ball. SECTION 4 ALTERNATING POSSESSION ART. 1 . . . Other than the start of the game and each extra period, the teams will alternate taking the ball out of bounds for a throw-in. The team obtaining control from the jump ball establishes the alternating-possession procedure, and the arrow is set toward the opponent's basket. Control may also be established by the results of a violation or foul, as in Rule 4-3. ART. 2 . . . To start the second, third and fourth quarters, the throw-in shall be from out of bounds at the division line opposite the scorer's and timer's table. Rule 6-3
