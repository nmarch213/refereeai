### Updated Comprehensive Basketball Officiating Rules Summary (2023-24)

#### Rule Interpretations and Practical Applications

- **Fouls and Violations**:

  - **Personal Fouls**: "A personal foul is committed when a player uses illegal physical contact to gain an advantage" (Rule 4, Section 12).
    - **Example**: A defender pushing an offensive player during a shooting attempt results in a personal foul.
  - **Team Fouls**: "When a team accumulates five team fouls in a quarter, the opposing team is awarded two free throws for each common foul thereafter" (Rule 4, Section 14). This replaces the previous one-and-one rule starting with the seventh team foul.

- **Traveling Violations**:

  - "A player who receives the ball while standing still may pivot but must not take more than two steps without dribbling" (Rule 4, Section 18).
    - **Scenario**: A player taking three steps to the basket without dribbling is called for traveling.

- **Throw-Ins**:
  - Officials must determine the throw-in location based on the violation's occurrence. "If the throw-in is to be in the team's frontcourt, it shall be at either the nearest 28-foot mark along each sideline or the nearest spot 3 feet outside the lane line and the end line" (Rule 7, Section 5).
    - **Backcourt Scenario**: If the throw-in is in the backcourt, it occurs at the designated spot nearest to where the foul or violation occurred.

#### End-of-Game Protocols

- **Game Management**: As the game nears its conclusion, officials should confirm critical details with the scorer, including:
  - Accuracy of the official scorebook.
  - Remaining time-outs for each team.
  - Number of team fouls and their impact on the bonus.
- **Timing Responsibilities**: Officials must ensure the timer is prepared to assist with clock management and last-second shot evaluations.

- **Last-Second Shot Protocol**: "Unless the ball is tapped, no try can be attempted on a throw-in or free throw with three-tenths (.3) of a second or less remaining."

- **Foul Administration**: If a foul occurs as the game-ending horn sounds and free throws could affect the outcome, they must be administered. If not, they will not be attempted.

- **Overtime Procedures**: If the score is tied at the end of regulation, officials must inform teams and table officials of overtime rules.

#### Bench Decorum

- **Coaching Box Compliance**: Coaches must remain within the coaching box. "Coaches who go beyond the 28-foot line, or more importantly, onto the playing court, gain a distinct advantage" (Rule 1, Section 5).
  - **Example**: A coach stepping onto the court to direct players may be penalized.
- **Misconduct**: Coaches and bench personnel must not engage in inappropriate behavior. "Coaches who leave the expanded bench area to engage officials inappropriately are subject to a warning or a bench technical foul."
- **Player Conduct**: "Players and coaches are not allowed to disrespectfully or inappropriately address and/or gesture at an official after a ruling is made on the court."
  - **Example**: A player taunting an opponent or making inappropriate gestures will be assessed a technical foul.

#### Game Situations and Rule Categories

  - "Players must remain behind the free-throw line until the ball has been released by the shooter" (Rule 9, Section 1).

    - The ball is legally touched by a player on the court.
    - A team gains initial control after a jump ball or unsuccessful goal attempt.
