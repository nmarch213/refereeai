ART. 3 . . . An intentional foul is a personal or technical foul that may or may not be premeditated and is not based solely on the severity of the act. Intentional fouls include, but are not limited to: a. Contact that neutralizes an opponent's obvious advantageous position. b. Contact away from the ball with an opponent who is clearly not involved with a play. c. Contact that is not a legitimate attempt to play the ball/player specifically designed to stop the clock or keep it from starting. d. Excessive contact with an opponent while the ball is live or until an airborne shooter returns to the floor. e. Contact with a thrower-in as in Rule 9-2-10 PENALTY 4. ART. 4 . . .

If personal, it involves, but is not limited to violent contact such as: striking, kicking and kneeing. If technical, it involves dead-ball contact or noncontact conduct at any time which is extreme or per- sistent, vulgar or abusive conduct. Fighting is a flagrant act.
